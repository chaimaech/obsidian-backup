My way back to life (Wandering Seoul)

Moments

Jungkook's interview

My grandpa and I shared a name but also a birthday in the lunar calendar. People often joked that my grandpa reincarnated before he died. We were born exactly 60 years apart, to the day. When I was seven, one night, he died. I don't remember much, but I guess when the joseunsaja came and called my grandpa's name and his birthday, my soul also left my body. I remember being confused because I could see myself sleeping between my grandparents. I followed the joseunsaja and my grandpa into the underworld. I don't know exactly what happened on the In-Between, but I, fortunately, came back before crossing Samdocheon*. I woke up after 3 days to my grandpa's funeral ending. But still, it was too late: my eyes already saw the unseen, so I was cursed with the ability to see the dead even in this world. 

My grandma thought I was hallucinating at first, but she never doubted me and refused to lock me up in a mental facility. She sought help from shamans and lost the little money she had to scammers. Until a joseungsaja knocked at our door. I've never been more afraid: I was convinced he was there to take my grandma, too. But no, he offered me a job. Apparently, Shin Samang herself heard about my situation and because my soul got tainted because of the system, but my soul still belonged to the living, she had a proposal: work as a part-time joseungsaja. In exchange, I'd get good luck in this life and score enough karma points to be reincarnated without going through the ten hells. To be honest, I just wanted to learn about how to get rid of the ghosts. Some appeared normal, and even if they didn't bother me much, they were a calm and happy presence around me. But some were crawling nightmares that latched on me and my loved ones. Being haunted can manifest in different forms, depending on the kind of spirit that is doing the haunting. It can cause things as simple as mood swings or frequent anger explosions or some tough luck like breaking a leg or injuring yourself while going down the stairs. But it can kill, too, driving the haunted to depression or even suicidal thoughts. I've seen one person getting into a huge traffic accident because of bad luck, too. And it can spill onto your loved ones. I was so angry, I had lost my grandpa, who was very dear to me, my hero... and seeing some ghosts trying to harm my grandma, the only family I had left, because I wouldn't answer them after making eye contact? I just wanted to get rid of them.

But I learned, after 23 years of doing this job, that these ghosts were– are only confused or wronged souls. A lot are just not ready to die and, let's face it, who is really? You're 15 and have so much potential, so much possibility, swallowed by the drunken mistake of a bastard... who doesn't even get caught and keeps living his life unbothered while your family collapses. Wouldn't you be angry? Wouldn't you want to be heard? You witnessed an injustice but no living person can hear you anymore. So you manifest the only way you can, by latching onto your anger and confusion, onto the person who wronged you or the person you felt the safest with because the remaining dead might be confused, but they all crave peace. It is but the nature of death after all.

"So you go to the afterlife and all?"

Well, I can't go past the Samdocheon so at first, i mainly helped capture spirits and delivering them to one of the doors..

Doors?

Well, before, any joseungsaja could summon doors to cross to the afterlife with their collected souls. But since it greatly disturbs electric and magnetic devices, there are 7 doors in all of Seoul where the joseungsaja gather the souls, and they cross collectively twice a day, at 4:44 in the morning and afternoon.

I'm retired now since going frequently to the afterlife is not a good thing for a living, so I manage one of the doors.

So you're like a doorman?

Not really; I'm more of a bar owner.

Huh?

Yeah, I own the seven pubs that hold the doors. I have like employees and staff.

And they deal with ghosts? Isn't that scary?

The staff consists of trained shamans and some joseungsaja. 

But don't humans feel like these places are gloomy? They're probably not that popular...

You might be surprised... 



Until I met a Joseungsaja almost a year later when a neighbor died. I

Jungkook's interview 2.0

My grandma thought I was hallucinating at first, but she never doubted me and refused to lock me up in a mental facility. She sought help from shamans and lost the little money she had to scammers. Until a joseungsaja knocked at our door, almost 3 years later. I've never been more afraid: he was there to take my grandma away from me and leave me alone. All because of me, because I was sick and tired of ghosts latching onto me and the retaliated by sticking to my grandma. Some ghosts appeared normal, and even if they didn't bother me much, they were a calm and happy presence around me. But some were crawling nightmares that latched on me and my loved ones. Being haunted can manifest in different forms, depending on the kind of spirit that is doing the haunting. It can cause things as simple as mood swings or frequent anger explosions or some tough luck like breaking a leg or injuring yourself while going down the stairs. But it can kill, too, driving the haunted to depression or even suicidal thoughts. I've seen one person getting into a huge traffic accident because of bad luck, too. And it can spill onto your loved ones. I was so angry, I had lost my grandpa, who was very dear to me, my hero... and seeing some Joseungsaja trying to take away my grandma, the only family I had left, because I wouldn't answer a ghost after making eye contact? 

I refused to budge and prevented the Joseungsaja from taking my grandma. I don't really know how I did it, but in the morning, she was still dead but her soul was still there. The Joseungsaja had disappeared a few hours prior and came back with two other men dressed in similar hanboks and a woman. 

I'll never forget that woman: she was tall, taller than any adult I've ever seen and she was so beautiful and serene. But she scared the hell out of me too: something in her made me want to scream and cower and cry and beg. I don't even know what for.

Her voice was odd too, it was like she wasn't used to having one and sometimes it sounded like she was talking backwards. She presented herself as the Halmeoni, the goddess of Death. I didn’t understand what it was at the time, just that it was a very important being and that I needed to listen.

She scolded me about keeping my grandma's soul from passing. That it was causing her pain and harming her chances of getting reincarnated. Despite the fear that was gripping me, my anger just... exploded and I literally yelled at this goddess, about how it was unfair that my grandma died because of me, because Death couldn't do it's job right, that I didn’t ask for seeing ghosts. Oddly enough, she listened. My grandma was taken away and she promised she was going to be treated well. Then she offered me a job: 





I was convinced he was there to take my grandma, too. But no, he offered me a job. Apparently, Shin Samang herself heard about my situation and because my soul got tainted because of the system, but my soul still belonged to the living, she had a proposal: work as a part-time joseungsaja.

MiniMoni

- I'm sorry.
- Save it, Namjoon. 
- No, Chim, I mean it. We may not be together anymore but I still care for you... a lot. And I owe you an apology, this much I know. I could've handled things better instead of... running away. 
Jimin looked at him and his heart hurt because the words did make him feel better. It meant he still had feelings for this man, right? Jimin could play dumb and act like he's all better but this man still held his heart, even years after they broke up.
No, that wasn't true. Jimin didn't love Namjoon anymore. And even if he did, the Namjoon he loved didn't exist anymore. This man was lightyears away from the Namjoon his heart remembered. He was bulkier, blonder, calmer... way wiser. And it hurt, because now Jimin has to mourn and grief a person and the lingering hope he has of ever rekindling things with his Namjoon. 
- Are you happy?
- Yes, Namjoon answered with no hesitation. 
- No, I mean...
*Does **she** make you happy?* is what he meant to ask.
- Does she make me happy? 
Jimin leva les yeux des mains qu'il tordait. Namjoon could always read his thoughts, it was unsettling that he still could when Jimin only built higher and Namjoon-proof walls around him.
He felt naked. 
- In a way, she does, he continued, blushing a bit. Her happiness doesn't depend on me or on mine... and my happiness doesn't depend on her or on her happiness. We're partners and friends before being lovers. I know i can count on her and she's knows I'm here for her and we have some common goals. We love each other a lot and respect each other enough to know that she's the most important person to herself and I'm the most important person to myself.
Jimin chuckled.
- It sounds boring, he couldn’t help but say. 
He was jealous and bitter that Namjoon moved on while he still waited for him. And it was all for... what? A rational very platonic kind of love? What a joke!
- It is, Namjoon smiled, not offended at all and it made Jimin even more mad. I kinda like boring... I know you always dreamed of true love. A beautiful and unrelenting love story even if a little poisonous. And that's okay, I just... wanted something simpler i guess. 
- I could've done simple... Jimin whispered, tears in his eyes.
- no, you could have not, let's be honest. And it would have killed me if you pretended because the most beautiful thing about you is your fire and radiance. Don't ever dim it for anyone. Now, I know I didn't deserve it and couldn't handle it. But don't ever try to change for anyone Chim. You're beautiful the way you are. I still wish I was braver, bolder, less fatigued, sometimes. That way, I could've stayed by your side. Could have weathered your highs and sheltered your lows.

Act: Chapter 05. First Love 43. Double standards
Begins: 2022/04/26 00:00 AM
Ends: 2022/04/26 00:00 AM
Description: Taehyung meets the director of Yoongi’s school and asks Yoongi to explain why he pushed the other girl instead of just accepting his suspension
Notes: Lee Jisung stole Im Yulia’s backpack and told other kids to run away with it (Yulia has transferred to the school a few weeks ago and only has a father). Yoongi tried to get the backpack back and pushed Jisung to the ground. Jisung’s parents are the new rich people of the neighborhood so even if Yoongi tells his version in front of the principal and Taehyung suggests asking Yulia, the principal refuses and still wants to suspend Yoongi.
“But Yoongi just told us that Lee Jisung stole a backpack, isn’t this boy going to receive punishment for that?”
“There’s no proof, Kim-ssi. It’s Yoongi’s word against Jisung’s.”
“Actually, we can ask the little Yulia, can we? Isn’t she concerned by all of this, since it’s her backpack?”
“Still, it would be her word against Jisung, Kim-ssi.”
“Oh, I see how it is, now. Jisung’s word must weigh as much as Yoongi and Yulia’s words, is he the son of some big donator, here?”
“I don’t like what you’re insinuating, Kim Taehyung-ssi.”
“And I don’t like that you only hold my Yoongi responsible where clearly, something is going with Jisung and I have the right to be concerned about that!”
“Yoongi will be suspended a week instead of three days.”
“What? Why?”
“Because I said so! You’re only Yoongi’s guardian, I’m not sure you’re qualified to question our methods nor our system! And clearly, something’s wrong with what you do with Yoongi as we can see his marks dropping and him developing bullying behavior! We’re the ones concerned, Kim-ssi.”

 Taehyung was stunned.
“That’s- that’s not true, Principal Choi, ahjussi is very kind to me, I promise I’ll do better at school, I’ll-“
“It’s okay, Yoongi, don’t worry. Principal Choi, maybe I didn’t introduce myself clearly before... Here’s my card.”
Taehyung saw with pleasure how the principal’s jaw dropped.
“Kim from Haebalagi Cosmetics?”
“Yes! I’m Yoongi’s guardian and I’m still learning but I’d do whatever it takes for him to go as far as he can with his talents and intelligence. I’m sure with the right support, he’ll do amazing things.”
“Ah yes, yes, Kim-ssi, I’m sorry, I didn’t know, please-“
“With all my due respect, principal Choi, you can save it. But clearly you missed a big chance here, my parents, my brothers and I, as you already know, love to donate to schools or finance kid’s programs through our foundation. It’s a shame, really... Because we look for genuinely impartial people who do not fear standing up to bullies.”
“Wait, Kim-ssi, we can-“
“I believe we took too much of your time already, I’ll get Yoongi back in here in a week, then, have a good day!”
“Oh?” Taehyung startled because he completly forgot the teacher behind him. “Yoongi is still coming tomorrow, isn’t he? It’s the zoo school trip and his late mother already paid the fee and signed the documents.”
“Ah yes, I believe so, thank you for reminding me, Dak-ssi! See you tomorrow!”
“Wait! Wait, Kim-ssi!”

Begins: 2022/04/26 00:00 AM Ends: 2022/04/26 00:00 AM
Description: Taehyung tells Jungkook about his ex (flashback) after the date, like a heart to heart talk
Notes: Baram was his first love and they dated for a year before she dropped out of school to pursue make up school instead of a business major
Her parents cut her out and they didn’t really like Taehyung (and the fact that he was adopted)
She gets pregnant even though Taehyung told her that he didn’t want kids as he was still in medical school and didn’t have any resources
She decides to keep the baby and of course even if he’s not ready, Taehyung steps up and tries to find solutions to take half of his courses online for a year after the birth of the baby and his parents are very supportive and they gift him the apartment they’re living in so they don’t have to pay rent and his mother gives her three boys shares in the company so they can have an income (that they all agree to reinvest unless they reallyy need it without their mum’s knowing)
Taehyung and Baram marries
They make it work but after the birth of Daeun, Taehyung hears Baram having sex on the phone with someone — someone he knows as her ex

 boyfriend
He does a paternity test and learns that Daeun wasn’t his daughter
He confronts Baram and breaks up with her but tells her he still will support her and Daeun but she needs to look for somewhere else to live
She becomes obsessed with Taehyung and is paranoid, thinking Taehyung cheats on her
She becomes weirdly affectionate and stuff with him and Taehyung sways a little, for Daeun, thinking Baram only made a mistake and he still considers Daeun as his own child
But then he learns, on a routine blood test, that she drugged him for almost 3 months
He talks to Namjoon about it and Namjoon and Taehyung’s lawyer convinces him to file a complaint because that’s dangerous and what if she does the same to Daeun
Baram doesn’t even deny Taehyung’s accusations, she simply states that she had to make sure Taehyung wasn’t cheating on her and she had to check his phone
Taehyung tells her she has until the end of the month until she can find a new apartment or he will proceed with the complaint
Baram disappears the next day
Namjoon learns that she went to Canada but she could be anywhere in the world
Because Daeun is legally his daughter, Taehyung files for a divorce (the papers are returned to him, signed), for a complaint for kidnapping and for drugging him (to get full or partial custody of Daeun)
- They kiss?

He debates wether to follow the bond or stay with Taehyung but he decides to follow the bond and Taehyung is having none of his shit and is adamant to go with him
Jungkook asks Taehyung to trust him and to not ask questions
The moment the police asks them to go home so they can wait for him if he goes back (Taehyung told them Yoongi knows his address and how to take the bus), they both go to follow the bond
Taehyung is driving and Jungkook is concentrating hard to keep up with the conversation and the bond and they drive a little dangerously
The arrive at some storehouse and they park a little far and finish the path walking
Taehyung wants to call the cops and Jungkook agrees so they do
They wait a little bit but then they hear Yoongi crying and Taehyung just loses it

 He barges in and Jungkook follows
They both fight the twelve people in there (after Taehyung yells at Yoongi to hide somewhere after the kid bites the man handling him) cause Taehyung has done some taekwondo when he was a teenager
Taehyung is injured badly on his arm and one of the bad guys fires a gun making both the adults stop
2/3 of the men are down and the big bad guy tries to fire at Taehyung but Jungkook is the one who gets shot
The police fortunately arrives and they tell them that they saw a car with Yoongi’s backpack at the red stop and decided to follow it and that they called the police when they were sure Yoongi was there but then one of the bad guys was hurting yoongi for crying so they couldn’t wait
Taehyung screams so Jungkook gets medical attention and insists to be the one to treat him (the moment he makes sure yoongi is okay)
but Jungkook has no injury and Jungkook tells him that the man was a bad shooter
Taehyung would have believed him if his shirt wasn’t soaked with blood and not in a way you get blood on yourself from other people you’re fighting, Taehyung has been an ER doctor for long enough to know the difference but he let it go cause he’s tired really
They go to the police station and if it wasn’t for Namjoon who practically yells that Yoongi is sleepy and needs rest and that no one of the adults will disappear tomorrow that the police lets them go

Jungkook and Taehyung ate more alike than they think. They're both people who are deeply afraid of rejection. They have very strong personalities, wills and egos. They both want to have impact on their entourage. Taehyung is more selfless (to a fault) and people-oriented whereas Jungkook is more selfish (to a fault). Still, they both have nurturing natures.

Taehyung is more on the "manipulative" side, since he wears masks depending on the person he wants love / attention from. Jungkook needs to be in control of his environment and refuses to show any vulnerability as it is a weakness in his eyes.

Both recognize themselves in Yoongi: Taehyung had his father murdered while he was hiding in a closet, just like Yoongi. Jungkook was dragged into the In-Between by mistake, when he didn’t ask for anything, just like Yoongi.

So, for the first time in their lives, Taehyung wants to make Yoongi happy even if Yoongi doesn't like him, and Jungkook wants to help someone even if it puts himself in harm's way.

Kim Taehyung
Personal struggles:
Taehyung feels lost, career-wise. He thought he wanted to be a thoracic surgeon but he's honest enough with himself to admit he was relieved when he lost his internship. He questions of being a doctor is something he really wanted or if it was also Baram's idea. 

Temporary solution:
He's not in denial, he knows things aren't going well. He shaped himself to be someone Baram would want. He just doesn’t know what he wants, what he needs. He's just paralyzed because he seems to have lost his dream. He's working at his father's gallery because he doesn’t know how to want something for himself but pleasing others? That he knows. He doesn't like that job but he feels like he couldn’t say no to his mother and wanted to please her. And he knows she's worried about him do she's trying to keep an eye on him by keeping him close.

Life lesson to be learned:
Type Two’s journey is to reclaim freedom from the tyranny of a world that only loves and approves of them if they fulfill the needs of others. When they learn to pay attention to their own needs, receive from others, and give only what is appropriate, then they can experience the pure joy of giving for its own sake, freely and lovingly.
- Love does not come from giving and getting – it is found in oneself.
- Joy can be found in others’ well-being and happiness, separate from what we do for them.

How it's learned:
? Yoongi genuinely loves Taehyung, not because of what Taehyung can do for him bit because it is Taehyung. And Taehyung adores Yoongi and wants him happy, and he doesn't care if he's not the one making him happy. 
Taehyung’s family also loves him. Not because he was a skilled doctor or because he was marrying into a chaebol and that opened some opportunities for his mother. They love him because he's him and they don't need him to do anything for them.

Solution:
Taehyung had this little dream he forgot about and it was opening a clinic in a difficult neighborhood and where he could help people even if not making him money. He'll be reminded of that, visiting Yoongi's neighborhood and hearing about how his mother couldn't take him to the doctor to get glasses or when he lost some of his hearing after a very high fever. He'll find joy again in that because it aligns with his values and let him feel useful and loved by strangers rather than his family (eho loves him either way) so he doesn’t have that pressure to be perfect and act in front of them to get ehat he needs (love and attention). He still feels guilty because he thinks he's selfish in doing that (helping others in order to gain love).

Jeon Jungkook
Personal struggles :
Jungkook is a loner. He's so angry all the time... at life, at his situation, at himself... He has a temper and doesn't like being seen as weak so he doesn't show any vulnerability. He's in control of every little thing in his life (demeanor etc). He's tired of being angry but he doesn't know how to do normal anymore. 

Jungkook's life was claimed by mistake since he shared his grandfather's name and Chinese birthday. He got lost in the In-Between, after following his grandfather abd the grim reaper who came to collect his soul. Since his soul got claimed, Shin Samang offered to sell it back to him. In fact, she knew a soul touched by death would struggle in life and wither away so she wanted to give him some kind of goal. But Jungkook doesn't know that. All he knows is that he must pay back a huge debt to the moirai when he didn’t ask for anything. 

The price to pay is to collect 5000 souls or work as a grim reaper for 45 years. Whatever happens first. Jungkook is determined not to work for Death until he's 52 so he's adamant on collecting the thousand souls as soon as he can. He can't be a reaper full time since he's human and needs to work regular jobs to earn a living so Jungkook mostly catch rogue souls or lost ones. He still manages to catch almost one per day which is a lot. He's been working since he was 16 (so gor 10 years now) and he still has 1700 souls to collect. 

His day job is an odd one too: he's a curse breaker and a magic artefacts dealer. Mostly... he also works as a freelance artist / designer and can do shifts as a waiter at Baekho's hole in the wall, when he needs a few extra bucks.

So yeah... Jungkook is tired. He dreams of getting the farthest away from Korea as soon as his debt is paid. He's learning french because he wants to go there and has a lot of savings to achieve his dream.

Jungkook is also touch starved and lonely. But it's by choice: being touched by death means you bring bad luck to your loved ones. You absorb the bad luck to balance out the yin energy but residues sticks to you like glitter so it's bound to bounce back to your entourage. 

Jungkook doesn't spend a penny on anything: he's savvy to a fault. The only thing he's spends money on is his gym / boxing club membership and his bike. 

Jungkook lives literally on ramyeon despite his love for cooking. He used to cook with his grandma in her restaurant. He still loves cooking for others but would not eat at all if he's by himself. 

Temporary solution:
Jungkook avoid relationships like the plague. He avoids getting attached because his situation causes harm to ogher people and because he feels too vulnerable when he gets attached. But this is no way to live.

Life lesson to be learned:
Type Eight’s journey is to embrace innocence and approach each situation with fresh eyes, appreciating that everyone has his or her own truth. This means learning to moderate their boundless, instinctual energy and delaying the tendency to go from urge to action in an all-or-nothing fashion.
- Vulnerability is not the same as weakness.
- True power comes from the appropriate or proportional application of force.

How it's learned:
? Yoongi is a kid and Jungkook needs to learn not to be so intense all the time.
Jungook does not understand Taehyung’s gentleness and selflessness at first, coining him as someone naïve and fake. At the same time, he witnesses Taehyung’s genuine care for Yoongi and wishes he had someone like that in his life. So he learns how it's Taehyung’s way of finding happiness and learns that to each their own and not to judge so harshly.

Solution:
Jungkook is freed from his debt (that didn't exist at all) and is tasked to coach Yoongi about his powers. He loves the responsibility and how he has a chance to be with someone who has the same problem as him (being touched) and that can't be harmed. He's careful around Taehyung and is afraid something's going to happen to him so he's overprotective if his newfound family. He still refuses to befriend other people because he's so afraid of bringing them bad luck but Taehyung’s family is so understanding and accepts him as he is, as long as he treats Taehyung well. Jungkook also learns not to make decisions for other people and let Taehyung handle being with him and the consequences of that. 











"You thought i had your life when i didn't. You had it all the time. Your soul was touched by had luck and death indeed but what you did with your life had nothing to do with it. But i knew you would come crawling back to me, the few times it happened in the past, people wanted to die because it was too hard. So i wanted to give you a chance at life in the only way i could: i gave you a goal, some deadline you could look forward to. I didn't know i would give you such anger and spite. Such will to live. Humans are interesting... not all of them, of course but i admire those who turn tragedies into xxx. They have the most peculiar reaction to grief. It's like being touched by death made you want to live to the fullest."

"Bullshit, you don't get to claim that."

"Of course, i don't claim your achievement, it was an honest mistake to claim your soul and i ensured no-one has to suffer your fate again as you know. I find it hilarious still that you want to live so badly because you were more aware of death than other humans"

Dokkaebis

Other Reapers trap their dokkaebis between two mirrors and only unleash them when they need doors. It's because dokkaebis are mischievous creatures who love to play pranks on humans or lure them hors des sentiers battus.
Jungkook refuses to trap Eunchae so she lives pretty much freely. His only condition is that she never materialize herself in front of a human.

What happened to Jungkook exactly?

***

Loud breaths. Shouts. Swords snapping. 
And fear.
A relentless fear that clung to his guts and refused to let him breathe. A snake named Terror that came to life in his belly and insidiously coiled around his chest. 
Everything was reddish black, but that was because his eyes were closed. With tremendous effort, he opened them, but his vision still seemed bathed in blood: all around him, a storm of reds and scarlet colours enveloped him and oppressed him from all sides. The air was hot and unbreathable. 
On his right, he heard cries of pain and, on his left, cries for help. A little further, gallops. He had to move before being buried by the impressive quantity of soot falling from the sky, a greyish and incandescent ash storm. 
He got up with difficulty, his armour weighing heavily on his shoulders, helping himself with his sword. Unable to stop himself, he looked around frantically, looking for her, praying to all the Gods, spirits, and ancestors that she was well. Safe. He knew he was probably in worse shape than her, that she didn’t need him. And yet, fear for her life clouded his thoughts and controlled his body, his mind.
Because that life was his to take. 
And that's when he saw her, standing upright in the midst of the chaos, the flames licking at the bodies surrounding her. Upright, with her double swords, her fierce gaze, and her determined stance. Upright and incredibly beautiful in her white hemp hanbok, adorned with red rose petals. 
No, not petals. Bloodstains. 
When their eyes met, he couldn’t help but hold his breath. He knew it was the end, and he was ready to honour his promise or welcome death from her delicate hands. He was vaguely aware of the familiar weight of his sword in his hand, yet so heavy to carry today. She, too, stared at him for a long time before letting out a piercing cry and rushing towards him, swift and deadly just like an arrow. He couldn’t move: she was mesmerising. He wouldn’t move. He thought he was ready, but maybe… Maybe another ending was possible, for them. He closed his eyes and sighed. 
When he reopened them, he no longer saw the woman who shared his heart, his bed, his life. The woman he loved. He only saw an enemy, the downfall of his people. His target. In a final burst of determination, he too began screaming, heading towards her, gradually gaining speed and momentum. He ignored the tears that left sooty streaks on his cheeks and just screamed. 
The battle wasn’t long, an elegant yet ruthless dance of swords, during which time stood still. She showed no mercy, no hesitation, and, for that, he was grateful. When, at last, he dealt her the final blow, she fell into his arms like a withering flower. 
At first, he avoided looking at her, his eyes skyward, filling with tears, and only lowered them when he felt a hand caressing his face. Then, with horror, he saw that she no longer bore her features but those of his sister, frowning and coughing blood. 
Startled, he let go of her and crawled back on all fours until his hand touched something ice cold. Heart pounding, he looked behind him and saw his brother's body, lips still red with blood. Slowly, sobbing, he looked around him and recognised the corpses of his niece, his two nephews, his general… All those whose death he had on his conscience littered the field around him. He was petrified, scared out of his wits, but it was nothing compared to the moment their milky white eyes turned in unison to him. 
He screamed, clutching his sword, then screamed some more. His heart beating like a drum, his face bathed in tears, a silent sob ripping from his dehydrated lips, Jungkook finally escaped from his nightmare.

A series of bad choices. 
If Hyejin had to sum up her life, this would definitely be how she would do so. By a cruel twist of fate, that was probably how she would sum up her death, too. 
Yet, the day had started well. After her shift at the Itaewon bar where she has been working for three weeks now, she managed to catch the 04:14 bus, the first one of the day. That was rare. She even managed to sleep a bit before getting on the second bus leading to her neighbourhood. 
As soon as she got home, she had time to plant a kiss on her sleeping son's forehead, take a shower and prepare a simple breakfast. All without waking her father. At the stroke of 6 a.m., she woke Yoongi up, helped him wash up and get dressed, and, together, they ate a bowl of rice each and the still-hot seaweed soup she made. After all, it was Yoongi's birthday. 
They talked, voices hushed in the early morning, about the upcoming school science fair. The boy was overly excited, he had a very specific idea, but Hyejin couldn’t understand half of the words he used. She tried to read books, on the bus or when she was on the graveyard shift at the convenience store. Books about stars and planets and spaceships, so she could at least join him in his excitement when he told her about something space-related. But this was the next level: all she understood was that he wanted to send something very high in the sky. And she was going to do everything she could to help him do it. 
“You still haven't told me what you want to do for your birthday,” she whispered to him, as she patted a napkin over the corner of the child's mouth. 
Yoongi seemed to hesitate, his eyes glued to the pattern on the ugly tablecloth that covered the kitchen table, suddenly more interesting than his mother's eyes. 
“Eomma, could we have cheese tteokbokki?” 
Hyejin scooped up her last spoonful of rice and stared intently at Yoongi. Cheese ttoekbokki was relatively inexpensive. Even if it was the child's favourite snack, she expected him to ask her for a toy or some fashionable backpack… Or even a cake! Usually, she couldn't afford it, but she had put aside a few wons, hiding them in a crack in the wall of their bedroom, to spoil him for his birthday. And that’s why she took that job all the way to Itaewon. But all there was in his downcast eyes was resignation. And a hint of worry. So, her heart sank at the thought that her baby had grown up far too quickly. Because she knew what he was doing. 
“Oh? Really? That's all?” she asked, overly detached. “I'm going to cancel the cake I ordered yesterday, then!” 
She smiled when her son's little cat-like eyes widened like saucers, his gaze fixed on her now. She didn’t really order a cake, but there were ones at the convenience store she could afford.
“A cake?” he shouted. 
A loud growl escaped from the next room. Yoongi and Hyejin glanced sideways at the closed door. 
“A cake?” the child repeated, this time in a whisper, when the loud snores resumed. 
“Yes! A chocolate cake! Would you like that?”
“With vanilla frosting?”
“With vanilla frosting!”
Yoongi’s gummy smile illuminated his face and Hyejin’s morning. A series of bad choices. That’s what her life was about. Or, rather, a series of bad reactions to all the bad things life threw at her. Because every so often, it didn’t really feel like Hyejin had a choice at all. But seeing Yoongi beaming at the simple mention of a cake made Hyejin's heart sink again, but for a whole different reason, this time. 
So, she thought that, yes, despite her life being a series of bad choices, keeping Yoongi was the one she never regretted making. 
Hyejin also remembered spotting some space-themed candles at the convenience store. She made a mental note to buy them too. 
“Quickly finish eating, we're going to be late for school!” she smiled at him. 
***

Hyejin was tired. But, again, when wasn’t she? The day passed in a frenzy of sheets to be washed and toilets to be scrubbed: she worked at a small love hotel for most of the day. Then she managed to sleep for an hour on the bus that took her to her third part-time job. 
So, now, in the middle of her shift at the grocery store, the lack of sleep was starting to catch up to her. She tried to focus on the book she was reading — an entry-level book about Saturn and its moons she borrowed from the library because Yoongi was having a Saturn phase. But she was pretty sure she read the same paragraph half an hour ago. Did she forget to turn the page? Luckily, there were never customers at this time of the day, when it was already too late to call it an afternoon but still too early to call it night. 
Head, eyes, and book heavy, she dozed behind the counter. Until— 
“Wah! You look like a real zombie!” 
Hyejin jumped, hand on her chest, her eyes scanning her surroundings frantically. Then, when she spotted Gahyeon, she heaved a sigh of relief.
“Yah! You scared me!” 
Gahyeon was the student who worked part-time here when Hyejin wasn’t. Hyejin frowned, though: there was still at least an hour before the end of her shift. Gahyeon seemed to understand Hyejin’s confusion. 
“Ah, Unnie, I finished early, and I know today is your little angel's birthday, so I thought I’d come to save you from this boring ass job!” 
Hyejin looked at Gahyeon in disbelief. 
“What?” Gaheyon beamed, quickly. “It’s not for you, it’s for Yoongi! And I expect you to cover for me sometime in the future, of course!” 
Hyejin knew that Gahyeon wasn’t serious: the younger girl was incredibly kind and always helped anyone around her when she could. A bright little sun, that’s what she was. 
The two young women were almost the same age and yet led two very different lives. Gahyeon was studying business and marketing, she had friends, went to parties, and had the time to be kind to people around her. Hyejin, on the other hand… Well, for starters, she didn’t even get to finish high school. Still, they shared a lot of the same interests, and they got along very well. 
At first, Gahyeon dropped by between classes sometimes to eat ramyeon — her dorm was not too far away from the convenience store. This is how they had come to sympathise. And they became even closer when Gahyeon took the part-time job. Hyejin would never dare to admit it, but she considered the student her best friend. 
“Thank you, Gahyeon-ah!” 
“It’s okay, Unnie! When he becomes a famous astronaut, I’ll definitely brag about wiping his snot and butt! He better be prepared!” 
Hyejin laughed, taking off her vest while heading to the small locker room at the back. She then folded it neatly and put it in her locker. When she came back to the front of the store, Gahyeon was already behind the counter, with a notebook, a cute purple pen case, and pens scattered all around, frowning over a very highlighted book page. 
Hyejin put 20,000 won on the counter in front of Gahyeon and lifted the bag containing a small chocolate cake with vanilla frosting and a pack of space candles she had in her hand. Gahyeon just laughed. 
“Have fun and send me a video of your little angel blowing out the candles!” 
Hyejin promised and ran to get her bus.
***

A shout. 
A sudden thud. 
A muffled pained moan. 
Plastic bags that fell to the ground. 
Hot tears and a silent prayer. 
Her father was bent in half over Yoongi, his little wrist squeezed between the old man’s dirty paws. Yoongi had a hand over his stomach and seemed to be in pain. 
The setting was familiar, too familiar to Hyejin. Although, usually, she was the one the old man was bent over, not Yoongi. Never Yoongi. 
Hyejin's blood swirled. She grabbed the first thing that came to her hand and threw it on her father's head. 
“Do not touch him!” she screamed. 
It was a bottle of soju, but it didn’t break. 
It only made the old man more angry, Hyejin felt it in the way his movements stilled and Yoongi’s eyes filled with even more fear. 
Her father turned his head around, slowly, freeing the little boy’s wrist, eyes glassy, features twisted with anger. Hyejin got between the man and her son. 
“How dare you, you bitch! Your bastard—”
He slapped her so hard, she fell on the floor. Then, he proceeded to take off his belt. 
“Yoongi,” she said with a firm voice, despite the fear that rocked her up and down. 
She crouched down, hugging a sobbing Yoongi, panic gripping her: she needed to check that her little one was okay, but she didn't have time.
“The closet,” she whispered. “And lock the room’s door.” 
She read the hesitation in the child's eyes. But she knew he would listen to her. She knew that Yoongi only wanted to help. But he couldn't do anything. She needed to know he was safe, so she gently pushed him towards the bedroom. 
The second blow hit her before Yoongi closed the door behind him. Hyejin, tried to hold back her cry, but failed miserably. Her eyes shut, she prayed that Yoongi would remember to put on his headphones and the playlist she made for him. Every time she could, she would add soothing songs or happy ones to console him and express her love. 
To drown her screams. 
This had happened far more often than she would ever dare to admit: her father, half-drunk, filled with rancour by life, filled with an anger that only he knew the source of, but only she knew the bitter taste of, beating her. 
Until today. 
Because that's what was different, this time around. Despite the blows, the insults, and the constant little harsh comments, her father had never raised his hand at Yoongi. She had always been able to prevent it or, at least, that's what she thought. Her mind wandered anywhere but in the living room of their crappy apartment — the only way she had to silence the physical pain. And it was filled with a thousand questions that could all be summarised into one: had this happened before? 
She had come home early today and had caught the scene. She always tried to never leave Yoongi alone with this monster, but with three jobs, it wasn't always easy. Guilt and another feeling, very foreign to Hyejin, seeped all over her and became even more unbearable than the pain of the blows. 
It was anger. A fit of anger fuelled by fear that she had somewhat failed her son, failed to protect her precocious little angel. And for the first time in years, she was aware of the hits inflicted on her body, drawing screams from her and hot reddish streaks all over her flesh — except her face. Because the bastard always managed not to touch Hyejin's face, as drunk and in bad shape as he would become. 
“How dare you throw a bottle at me? You whore!” 
A blow, on her stomach. She lost her breath. 
“Wasn’t it enough disrespect for you to fool around and get pregnant? To bring a bastard under my roof?” 
A blow, on her back. A muffled cry. 
“Noooo, you throw bottles at me, now!” 
A blow, on her leg. A scream and more tears. 
“I’m gonna kill you…” 
He lifted the belt, again and she braced herself. But the blow never came. He lowered it, the buckle pounding loudly against the floor. 
“No more disrespect. I’m going to kill you then kill your bastard—”
“No.”
Her voice was desperate yet firm, commanding. A desire that she had not known for years crept into her heart: the desire to protect herself, to no longer suffer. She had to survive to protect her son. 
The old man looked at her, surprised. Clearly confused. 
“What did you say?” 
Hyejin tried to even her breathing. With a hand, she leaned against the door and tried to get up on her right leg — the one that wasn’t hit. All of her body was aching. Hell, even breathing was painful! Fear and tears ragged her breath, and she was shaking like a dead leaf. But anger fuelled her determination. She had enough. So, never again. 
“This is the last time you put your hand on me or my son.” 
The old man smirked. And Hyejin’s determination began to crumble. She didn’t know what kind of reaction she was expecting. She didn’t really think things through as she was acting on instincts and adrenaline. Was she expecting him to encourage her and open the door for her, so she can escape with her son? No, of course not, she wasn’t delusional. But she didn’t expect him to smirk. She didn’t expect his expression to become even more venomous. 
“Is that so?” 
He was laughing now. And every cackle sent shivers down Hyejin’s spine. 
“And where would you go, mmhh??” 
Hyejin didn’t have an answer to that. Or, rather, she had one, but it wasn’t a practical one: after all, anywhere was better than here. He took her hard-earned money, so she had no savings. He made sure to scare every person in her life, so she had no-one. And she could’ve endured it all, as long as she was the only one suffering at the hands of this monster. But now that he hurt Yoongi… Never again. 
The old man stopped laughing suddenly.
It was so sudden that Hyejin couldn’t help but look at him. 
“Change of plans, I’m going to kill him but then—” 
His smile grew bigger. 
“I’ll let you live, so you never forget who you owe your life to, you bitch.” 
Things then happened fast. So fast that Hyejin didn't understand at first. All she knew was that her father shoved her to get past her to the door she was standing in front of. A feral need made her stand up on her feet in the blink of an eye, again. She didn’t feel pain anymore. Not pain, not anger, nothing at all. Just fear. Pure and utter horror. 
She grasped her father’s arm to stop him, clawing at his skin, and he hissed when he tried to escape her grip. He frowned when she landed on the floor, threw the belt and grabbed the bat he kept by the TV. Now, he was aiming for her head. Her instinct made her raise her right arm to protect herself, and she heard a crack. She screamed again, her left wrist tightening around her arm and her eyes closed. 
Another blow, this time to the back of her head. 
Hyejin’s ears were ringing, loud, and her vision was beginning to blur. But through the fog muffling the surrounding noises, she heard the distinctive hiss the tip of the bat was making, being dragged on the floor. She tried to raise her head and that’s when she understood she was lying on the floor. All she could see was her father’s steps toward her. Toward the door. Toward Yoongi. 
Before she could think, she was standing in front of her father again, and she jumped on him, screaming, clawing at every inch of flesh she could find. And the man finally lost balance. He was trying to get Hyejin off him, but all he could do was stumble back. And then, he fell backward, and his head landed on the metal and glass table, shattering it. 
Hyejin crawled back, away from the old man. She was still breathing very harshly, crying and sobbing from time to time. Her father was lying on the ground, his head streaked with blood and broken glass. She couldn’t see anything else, her vision was blurry again. And she was in pain. Her face, her right arm, her leg, her chest, her stomach, and the back of her head. Everything was aching. Her heart too. 
In a sad attempt, she tried to open the door, but the handle was too high to grab. She gave up. 
An annoying buzz drowned out the myriad of noises around her. Hyejin was sleepy now. She knew someone was talking to her, but she couldn't quite register their words. They were urging her to get up, handling her not so gently, putting her on her legs, putting something around her wrists. But all she wanted was to see Yoongi. She tried to tell them, but only a gargle came out of her mouth. The sound had an awful metallic and rusty taste. The noises and lights around her became more frantic. 
And Hyejin was feeling the fatigue of the last few weeks — no, scratch that, the last few years — take possession of her body. She wanted to sleep, only a little. Then she would go find Yoongi and leave this crappy apartment. Maybe they would go to Gahyeon? Yeah, they could. She loved Yoongi. When she wakes up, she was going to do that. Sleeping was a good idea. Just a little nap. Five minutes, that's all she needed. 
She closed her eyes.

It was 23:32 and JungKook was late.
And if there was one thing JungKook hated more than anything, it was being late. He had to be at Hangil General Hospital to collect Oh Hyejin’s soul in exactly 46 minutes, according to his old watch. The thing is he was nowhere near the damn hospital yet, and JungKook was almost tempted to become visible to humans just to ask for directions.
“It must be here…”, he kept mumbling to himself.
It wasn’t really his fault, he never worked in Dobong-gu before. Usually, Jungkook was assigned to Gangbuk-gu, the neighbouring district. But the Grim Reapers of the area were on a very delicate case — some gas leak incident — and asked for help. And Jungkook agreed in the blink of an eye: the idea of a departing soul being alone, scared, with no one to help was unbearable to him, for some reason. That’s why he was wandering in an unfamiliar street even when his shift ended more than an hour ago.
He was on Nohae Street, as the Dispatcher told him, but all he could see was a brownish brick wall. Maybe the hospital was on the other side of the wall? Which, if that was the case, was a stupid move from the Dispatcher!
That’s when he heard ambulance sirens and saw bright red lights turning right at the intersection.
“Finally!”
He closed his eyes in utter concentration and felt the familiar feeling of warmth all over his back. He spread his wings and took off, flying into the direction the ambulance was heading. 
Soon enough, he found himself in the hospital parking lot. And Jungkook thought that Hangil General Hospital was a sad white-walled building with not much light nor life. As soon as his wings disappeared behind his back, he ran and walked through the emergency double door, passing by the previous ambulance.
Jungkook glanced at his watch: 43 minutes left.
The hall was a storm of noises and colours and panic. There were occupied beds all over. He ignored it all and approached and scanned the information board to find OR number 4. That was where Oh Hyejin was going to be taken, where she was going to die. But he couldn’t find anything about Operation Rooms, just indications about the multiple general services.
While he was debating again if it would be worth it to just make himself visible and ask the front desk nurse, his ears perked at something behind him.
“Oh Hyejin, 24-year-old, Female. GCS 3.”
Jungkook turned in a snap. That was his client, on a stretcher pushed by 2 paramedics, surrounded by several nurses in purple and two doctors in green.
“BP 90 over 50. Tachy 140. Stats 100%. Pressure dressing on her head, but it’s still bleeding pretty bad,“ one of the paramedics continued.
Four men — two of them with police officer uniforms — followed the stretcher closely.
“All right, we're gonna replace the King with an ET”, one of the doctors said, and Jungkook could only see his broad back, but his voice was thicker than honey.
“Nurse Do, grab the intubation kit. Let's move her on my count. One… Two… Three.“
Jungkook followed them, and they were now in a small glass-walled room by the entrance. The doctor and the nurses lifted Oh Hyejin from the stretcher to install her onto one of the beds. Jungkook frowned: his client had her hands cuffed. He looked at the policemen and the two other men, who were probably detectives. All were pretty indifferent to Oh Hyejin’s fate and one even looked bored.
“Breath sounds good on both sides,” the small doctor said, winding a stethoscope around her neck.
“All right. She’s still bleeding too much for my liking. Hang two units of blood.“
“Yes, Doctor.”
“Get me a plastic tray.”
“Got it.”
“We need to stop these bleeders. Saline?“
“Here.”
“Oh, Doctor Kim, she's got glass shards in her scalp,“ one of the nurses observed.
“Heart rate is erratic, Doctor,” the one surnamed Do warned.
“Suction”, Doctor Kim ordered with a steady and perfectly calm voice.
“Yeah, got it.”
Jungkook watched them, impressed. No, fascinated. More than he cared to admit. It was a well-oiled machine, he thought to himself. The doctor’s orders flew, and the nurses responded quickly and efficiently. There was no hesitation, only trust, and precision.
Suddenly, one of the machine’s beeping got more erratic.
“Pressure's falling,” a nurse shouted.
“Nurse Do, get me the ultrasound!” Then, a few seconds later: “There's free fluid in her abdomen.”
“Pressure's still low,” the nurse reminded him.
“The thing is, she's not stable enough to go to CT. We need to open her up now. Call the OR and tell them we're on our way up.“
“Yes, Doctor Kim.”
“Also, get these handcuffs off her.”
Jungkook glanced at the doctor. He still could only see his back — and his fluffy dark hair. But for the first time, tonight, he seemed irritated, which surprised the Reaper. The detective’s answer confused Jungkook even more.
“She killed her father, that woman is dangerous!”
Jungkook laid his eyes on the man who just spoke. His voice was coated in venom and the Reaper frowned: he didn’t have the time to read his client’s folder and regretted it now. But, really, Mari — his favourite Dispatcher — only contacted him two hours ago about the case. And he still had to go to the Northern Dispatch Center to officially and personally request this case because it couldn’t be assigned it to him automatically since he was from another district. And it was a lot of paperwork.
Like, a lot.
“She’s unconscious, I'll take my chances”, the doctor answered calmly.
“She even went to juvie for robbery… Twice! She’s a criminal!“ the detective insisted.
Jungkook was used to it now. He accompanied many people in their death. After all, it was his job. And he saw it all: beautiful souls and less beautiful ones. None equal in life but all equal before death. Still, for Jungkook, they all deserved to be treated with decency. Oh Hyejin could have led a bad life, full of bad choices and bad decisions, she still deserved to be given a proper chance to be saved. Even if it was only to face justice afterward. 
So, by now, Jungkook wanted to smack the detective, badly.
“She's also my patient”, Doctor Kim answered, taking none of the detective’s attitude. “I can't treat her properly until the cuffs are off.”
Three heartbeats, punctuated by the machines’ noises — some constant, some uncertain — and the stillness of everyone. One. Two. Three. Then…
“We really don’t have time for this bullshit, detective, she’s dying.”
The detective finally seemed to understand that he wasn’t going to win this one.
“All right… But if anything happens, it’s on you, doctor!“ he yelled, an accusing — or threatening — finger pointed at the doctor. 
“And if she dies because we lost precious seconds here, it’s on you.”
Jungkook didn’t think it could be possible, but the detective’s expression got even angrier than before. He still approached the bed — clearly taking his time — and uncuffed the girl.
The staff began moving before the doctor could yell an exasperated “To the OR”.
Storm. 
That was the word Jungkook associated with the doctor. 
That was a silly game he did, sometimes… Assigning a word to people. For example, for his boss, Hanee, her word was Fire and Jungkook couldn’t explain why. Maybe because of her temperament but also her warmth. For Lee Chungho, he could. He was one of the Reapers with whom he shared Gangbuk-gu's responsibilities. His word was Cigarette — because he always seemed tired, like a cigarette smoked to the edge of the filter, threatening to crumble to ashes at the first gush of wind. 
Usually, though, Jungkook only assigned words to people he knew, not random strangers he didn’t even see the face of. Even if their voice was deep like the ocean and their hair fluffy like a honeyed cloud.
He didn’t have the time to dwell on that or meditate about why Doctor Kim was a Storm, though. While following the medical crew to the OR, Jungkook took his black notebook from his inside pocket. He opened it to the first page where only the name of current his client was written. But the more he read, new sentences appeared, carving Oh Hyejin’s story on the grainy paper.
Jungkook read about her — too brief of a — life. And about her miserable death. About her not many desires, her frail hopes, and her only regret: her son.
The Reaper knew then that helping Oh Hyejin let go of her worldly attachments wasn’t going to be easy.
Several minutes had passed before Jungkook finally lifted his eyes from his notebook. They were now in Operating Room number 4 and there were two doctors bent on Oh Hyejin’s body now. The room was cold and smelled nauseating and overpowering and the Reaper may have done this job for 777 years, he still couldn’t get used to it.
All he could do, now, was wait. So, for the first time, Jungkook took the time to observe Oh Hyejin. She was petite and frail, and he could see that life didn’t spare her. She was still beautiful, with her long dark locks framing her small face. Her skin was grey-ish, and she had some faint scars on her blood-soaked arms — nothing too noticeable, it was mostly in the way there were faint, crisp white scratches on her golden skin. Between the old marks, though, bruises recounted the painful evening on her skin. 
Jungkook knew she was unconscious, dying. But it felt like she was just asleep. 
Resting.
That didn’t prevent a frown from knotting her eyebrows.
“Lap sponges”, the doctor ordered.
“Yes, Doctor Kim.”
Doctor Kim had big steady hands and gentle but sharp focused hazel eyes.  The kind that held stars and galaxies in them and where you could get easily lost, Jungkook thought. He couldn’t see the rest of his face, though, as Doctor Kim was wearing a mask.
“And keep them coming… I can’t see shit…”
“Language, Doctor Kim!”
The other doctor was both hands wrist-deep in Hyejin’s stomach. Her eyes were focused on the ceiling like she was trying to see with her hands. 
“There's too much blood, Doctor Hwang! And I can't see where it's coming from.”
“Feel for it, then,“ she answered.
“Pressure's dropping again,” a man sitting in a corner said, his back to the operating bed, his eyes glued to the lights and noises of a big machine.
Jungkook looked at his watch. It was a pretty shiny thing, embossed and polished by the years. A beautiful object that announced terrible things. 
Two minutes left.
“The belly is still packed, and the spleen is in pieces. Something else is bleeding.”
“Okay, okay… Run the bowel…”
“Oh, the mesentery's bleeding! I will clamp it, okay? Doctor Kim, you get the spleen.”
“Curved 8 to me… Metz scissors.”
“Scissors.”
“Bowl.”
“Bowl”, a nurse answers.
“Thank you. I'll hold the clamp, you tie.”
“All right, the bleeding stopped. How's she doing?”
“Pressure's still dropping…”
“Fuck!”
“Taehyung, language!”
“Noona, it’s not the time, something else is bleeding, and we don’t know what it is!” Doctor Kim yells and Jungkook could hear it in his voice that he was alarmed now.
00:18. It was time.
Jungkook stood up straight, opened his notebook again on the first page, and called for the dead, pronouncing every syllable correctly and distinctly. Three times.
“Oh Hyejin. Oh Hyejin. Oh Hyejin.”
The woman’s soul rose from her body. She was still clinging to life, Jungkook could see it in the way her soul seemed a little immaterial like she was some sort of ghost. Her eyes scanned the room, frenetically, until they met Jungkook’s.
“I am dead.”
It wasn’t a question. So, Jungkook didn’t answer.
“I can’t. I can’t die. Not now, he— He needs me.”
Jungkook approached her, slowly, and held out his hand to her. She observed it, wary. The Reaphaer knew she must think that once she took it, there was no going back. Jungkook didn’t have the heart to tell her that it didn’t matter whether she took it or not: there was already no going back.
“I really can’t die”, she said, her eyes still locked on his hand, her voice calm, too calm. “My son. My son needs me.”
“I know”, Jungkook sighed. “I know, Gogeg-nim…”
After what seemed like an eternity, she finally grabbed Jungkook’s hand. Then, she began crying and the more she cried, the more her appearance was tangible.
Then, a long beep rang in the room.
“Oh Hyejin.”, Doctor Kim said, his voice slightly cracking. “Time of death: 00:21.”

The rebirth of the Inugami
Lee Chungho arrived at the Oh household mere seconds before his client’s death. And, not for the first time, he was glad the bureaucracy of the Afterworld and the paperwork made him late because the scene at the tiny apartment was gut-churning. Two bodies were lying on the floor. There was a female one crawling with difficulty towards a closed door, every strut snatching a pained moan from her. And the other had blood pooling from the head, glass shattered around him like a halo. But he was no angel, Lee Chungho knew that, because he was his client. All he had about him was a name — Oh Sangeok, and an address but he read a brief summary of his life on his way here that testified to his cruelty. So he knew.
Lee Chungho crouched beside his client’s body and observed him. He was big and buff and his skin looked yellow like some kind of old parchment. He had a baseball bat in one of his hands, the end of which was blood red and looked sticky. A belt lied on the floor next to the female body, like a snake ready to pounce on her, the buckle catching the reflections of the buzzing light from the ceiling. 
“Oh Sangeok. Oh Sangeok. Oh Sangeok,” Lee Chungho called, speaking each syllable distinctly, loud and clear, his eyes on the Chinese hanja on his notebook.
A groan escaped from Oh Sangeok and his soul rose from his body, his silhouette clear and distinct, not immaterial as it could sometimes be for some people who were still clinging to life. Oh Sangeok’s death was brutal and quick, his passing to the In-Between clean and tangible.
The dead man looked at the Reaper, frowning.
“I’m dead,” he said, and Chugho frowned too, in turn. His client seemed aware and not at all surprised. He looked at the sobbing girl near the door and his face painted with a loud guilt.
“She’s finally free,” he whispered.
Lee Chungho didn't have time to utter a word, when the rice cooker beeped, startling him. Then it was the TV, then the light in the hallway and the kitchen. A small radio on a shelf so high the Reaper was sure it hadn't been used in ages, blared white noise and catchy music in intermittence. The volume of the TV seemed to gradually increase, becoming almost deafening and drowning out Oh Sangeok's mad litany. As tall and buff as he was, he looked like a little boy now, and had taken refuge under the table, his hand over his ears, his eyes tightly shut.
Then everything shut down, the lights went out and that’s when Lee Chungho heard it.
The growl.
At first, it wasn’t faint but it wasn’t clear, like some background noise or like it was coming from a dog next door. Or from the walls. It was only when all the devices went off and quietness reigned in the apartment, that Chungho realized that the noise had been there since the moment he had set foot in this hovel. 
Now, it was coming from one of the corner of the apartment. He turned carefully his head to the source of the growl and only saw two eyes, red and vicious before the thing was on him.
The Reaper hadn’t felt pain that searing in 26 years and he screamed until darkness consumed him.

Jungkook pocket watch was reading 23:32 thus indicating he was late. And Jungkook hated being late. More often than not, it meant trouble. 

He had to be at Hangil General Hospital to collect Oh Hyejin’s soul in exactly 46 minutes.

The thing is, he was nowhere near the damn hospital yet.

“It must be here…”, he kept mumbling to himself, wishing once again he could bring his phone on missions, because he had no idea where he was.

At that point, JungKook was almost tempted to become visible to humans just to ask the few passerbys for directions.

It wasn't his fault being late, for once, though: he never worked in Dobong-gu before. Usually, Jungkook was assigned to Gangbuk-gu, the neighbouring district. But the Grim Reapers of the area were on a very delicate case — some gas leak incident. If not handled quickly and efficiently, dead souls could become evil spirits or, worse, an egg spirit – when several souls fuse together forming a single and powerful ghost – could form. It was rare but the chances of it happening after a collective disaster were too high to ignore. So every bit of help was welcome.

And, of course, Jungkook agreed in the blink of an eye: he was forbidden to go to the gas leak incident site but he was tasked to collect regular souls, not rogue ones for once. Ones the busy "real" Reapers wouldn't be able to get to. And if he managed his time and locations well, he would be able to collect at least 4 souls before he had to head to his regular job at dawn. Jungkook absolutely needed that: he hadn't met his quota for two weeks now.

A blue flame voleta ELEPHANT in front of Jungkook's face, trying to get his attention. 

"Huh?" Jungkook followed the flame with his eyes and saw an ambulance turning right at the intersection. He smiled, relieved. 

“What would i do without you, Eunchae-yah!”

The blue flame fluttered for a bit before settling on Jungkook's right shoulder. 

He closed his eyes in utter concentration and felt the familiar feeling of warmth all over his back. He spread his wings and took off, flying into the direction the ambulance was heading. 
Soon enough, he found himself in the hospital parking lot. 

Hangil General Hospital was a sad white-walled building with not much light nor life. As soon as his wings disappeared behind his back, he ran and walked through the emergency double door, passing by the previous ambulance.

Jungkook glanced at his watch: 43 minutes left.

The hall was a storm of noises and colours and panic. There were occupied beds all over. He ignored it all and approached and scanned the information board to find OR number 4. That was where Oh Hyejin was going to be taken, where she was going to die. But he couldn’t find anything about Operation Rooms, just indications about the multiple general services.
While he was debating again if it would be worth it to just make himself visible and ask the front desk nurse, his ears perked at something behind him.

“Oh Hyejin, 24-year-old, Female. GCS 3.”
Jungkook turned in a snap. That was his client, on a stretcher pushed by 2 paramedics, surrounded by several nurses in purple and two doctors in green.
“BP 90 over 50. Tachy 140. Stats 100%. Pressure dressing on her head, but it’s still bleeding pretty bad,“ one of the paramedics continued.
Four men — two of them with police officer uniforms — followed the stretcher closely.
“All right, we're gonna replace the King with an ET”, one of the doctors said, and Jungkook could only see his broad back, but his voice was thicker than honey.
“Nurse Do, grab the intubation kit. Let's move her on my count. One… Two… Three.“

Jungkook followed them, until they got to a small glass-walled room by the entrance. The doctor and the nurses lifted Oh Hyejin from the stretcher to install her onto one of the beds. Jungkook frowned: his client had her hands cuffed. He looked at the policemen and the two other men, who were probably detectives. All were pretty indifferent to Oh Hyejin’s fate and one even looked bored.
“Breath sounds good on both sides,” the small doctor said, winding a stethoscope around her neck.
“All right. She’s still bleeding too much for my liking. Hang two units of blood.“
“Yes, Doctor.”
“Get me a plastic tray.”
“Got it.”
“We need to stop these bleeders. Saline?“
“Here.”
“Oh, Doctor Kim, she's got glass shards in her scalp,“ one of the nurses observed.
“Heart rate is erratic, Doctor,” the one surnamed Do warned.
“Suction”, Doctor Kim ordered with a steady and perfectly calm voice.
“Yeah, got it.”
Jungkook watched them, impressed. No, fascinated. More than he cared to admit. It was a well-oiled machine, he thought to himself. The doctor’s orders flew, and the nurses responded quickly and efficiently. There was no hesitation, only trust, and precision.
Suddenly, one of the machine’s beeping got more erratic.
“Pressure's falling,” a nurse shouted.
“Nurse Do, get me the ultrasound!” Then, a few seconds later: “There's free fluid in her abdomen.”

“Also, get these handcuffs off her.”
Jungkook glanced at the doctor. He still could only see his back — and his fluffy dark hair. But for the first time, tonight, he seemed irritated, which surprised the Reaper. The detective’s answer confused Jungkook even more.
“She killed her father, that woman is dangerous!”
Jungkook laid his eyes on the man who just spoke. His voice was coated in venom and the Reaper frowned: he didn’t have the time to read his client’s folder and regretted it now. 

But, really, Eunchae informed him of the four opportunities only  two hours ago. And he still had to go to the Northern Lighthouse to officially and personally answer the requests because it couldn’t be assigned it to him automatically since he was from another district. And it was a lot of paperwork.
Like, a lot.

Jungkook observed the doctor's back. He was tense so he expected the man to explode and command the handcuffs to be taken. Jungkook was sure he was the kind of man who wielede authority and was used to get what he wanted.

Surprisingly, when he spoke again, his voice has lost all authority and was singsongy, almost subversive. 

"Ah, detective, seeing how she's unconscious, I'lltake my chances!" The doctor beamed.

*Ugh*, Jungkook hated people like doctor Kim. He hated fake people. Because maybe it wasn't obvious to everyone but Jungkook could see how ticked doctor Kim was.

“She even went to juvie for robbery… Twice! She’s a criminal!“ the detective insisted.
Jungkook was used to it now. He accompanied many people in their death. After all, it was his job. And he saw it all: beautiful souls and less beautiful ones. None equal in life but all equal before death. Still, for Jungkook, they all deserved to be treated with decency. Oh Hyejin could have led a bad life, full of bad choices and bad decisions, she still deserved to be given a proper chance to be saved. Even if it was only to face justice afterward. 

So, by now, Jungkook wanted to smack the detective, badly.

“She's also my patient”, Doctor Kim answered, still a smile in his voice. “I can't treat her properly until the cuffs are off. And I'm pretty sure you must be busy with more important thing yhan to safeguard a dying woman. If something happens, ill take responsibility. ”
Three heartbeats, punctuated by the machines’ noises — some constant, some uncertain — and the stillness of everyone. One. Two. Three. Then…
“We really don’t have time for this bullshit, detective, she’s dying.”
The detective finally seemed to understand that he wasn’t going to win this one.
“All right… But if anything happens, it’s on you, doctor!“ he yelled, an accusing — or threatening — finger pointed at the doctor. 
“And if she dies because we lost precious seconds here, it’s on you.”
Jungkook didn’t think it could be possible, but the detective’s expression got even angrier than before. He still approached the bed — clearly taking his time — and uncuffed the girl.
The staff began moving before the doctor could yell an exasperated “To the OR”.

He didn’t have the time to dwell on that or meditate about why Doctor Kim was a Storm, though. While following the medical crew to the OR, Jungkook took his black notebook from his inside pocket. He opened it to the first page where only the name of current his client was written. But the more he read, new sentences appeared, carving Oh Hyejin’s story on the grainy paper.
Jungkook read about her — too brief of a — life. And about her miserable death. About her not many desires, her frail hopes, and her only regret: her son.
The Reaper knew then that helping Oh Hyejin let go of her worldly attachments wasn’t going to be easy.
Several minutes had passed before Jungkook finally lifted his eyes from his notebook. They were now in Operating Room number 4 and there were two doctors bent on Oh Hyejin’s body now. The room was cold and smelled nauseating and overpowering and the Reaper may have done this job for 777 years, he still couldn’t get used to it.
All he could do, now, was wait. So, for the first time, Jungkook took the time to observe Oh Hyejin. She was petite and frail, and he could see that life didn’t spare her. She was still beautiful, with her long dark locks framing her small face. Her skin was grey-ish, and she had some faint scars on her blood-soaked arms — nothing too noticeable, it was mostly in the way there were faint, crisp white scratches on her golden skin. Between the old marks, though, bruises recounted the painful evening on her skin. 
Jungkook knew she was unconscious, dying. But it felt like she was just asleep. 
Resting.
That didn’t prevent a frown from knotting her eyebrows.
“Lap sponges”, the doctor ordered.
“Yes, Doctor Kim.”
Doctor Kim had big steady hands and gentle but sharp focused hazel eyes.  The kind that held stars and galaxies in them and where you could get easily lost, Jungkook thought. He couldn’t see the rest of his face, though, as Doctor Kim was wearing a mask.
“And keep them coming… I can’t see shit…”
“Language, Doctor Kim!”
The other doctor was both hands wrist-deep in Hyejin’s stomach. Her eyes were focused on the ceiling like she was trying to see with her hands. 
“There's too much blood, Doctor Hwang! And I can't see where it's coming from.”
“Feel for it, then,“ she answered.
“Pressure's dropping again,” a man sitting in a corner said, his back to the operating bed, his eyes glued to the lights and noises of a big machine.
Jungkook looked at his watch. It was a pretty shiny thing, embossed and polished by the years. A beautiful object that announced terrible things. 
Two minutes left.
“The belly is still packed, and the spleen is in pieces. Something else is bleeding.”
“Okay, okay… Run the bowel…”
“Oh, the mesentery's bleeding! I will clamp it, okay? Doctor Kim, you get the spleen.”
“Curved 8 to me… Metz scissors.”
“Scissors.”
“Bowl.”
“Bowl”, a nurse answers.
“Thank you. I'll hold the clamp, you tie.”
“All right, the bleeding stopped. How's she doing?”
“Pressure's still dropping…”
“Fuck!”
“Taehyung, language!”
“Noona, it’s not the time, something else is bleeding, and we don’t know what it is!” Doctor Kim yells and Jungkook could hear it in his voice that he was alarmed now.
00:18. It was time.
Jungkook stood up straight, opened his notebook again on the first page, and called for the dead, pronouncing every syllable correctly and distinctly. Three times.
“Oh Hyejin. Oh Hyejin. Oh Hyejin.”
The woman’s soul rose from her body. She was still clinging to life, Jungkook could see it in the way her soul seemed a little immaterial like she was some sort of ghost. Her eyes scanned the room, frenetically, until they met Jungkook’s.

“I really can’t die”, she said, her eyes still locked on his hand, her voice calm, too calm. “My son. My son needs me.”
“I know”, Jungkook sighed. “I know, Gogeg-nim…”
After what seemed like an eternity, she finally grabbed Jungkook’s hand. Then, she began crying and the more she cried, the more her appearance was tangible.
Then, a long beep rang in the room.
“Oh Hyejin.”, Doctor Kim said, his voice slightly cracking. “Time of death: 00:21.”
***

, since he had to work more hours that week and couldn't "hunt" at night.

Because Jungkook was a peculiar Joseungsaja. A _live_ one. 

 That’s why he was wandering in an unfamiliar street even when his shift ended more than an hour ago.

***

Usually, when a person died, they were confused and disoriented. Sometimes, they couldn’t control their limbs, like the sudden absence of a body made them lighter, less anchored, or like gravity didn’t have the same hold on them anymore. After a few minutes or so, they would start to forget the circumstances of their death, be it a painful or a peaceful one. Then, they remembered little of their life, too: only major events or turning points. The happiest the memory, the easier and the better they remembered it. Half an hour or so after their Death, souls usually couldn’t recall their closed ones’ names or faces. Only feelings: warmth, love, fear…
That was the nature of Death. 
The goal was to prevent souls from wandering the Living Realm and ease them into the next step. They would regain all their memories after they crossed the Gates of the Arterlife so they could defend themselves before the Seven Gods.
Death wasn’t painful nor scary. It took only when it couldn’t help it, only when the strings of fate exhausted all their possibilities.
Regrets were the last things that clung onto the new departed souls. Regrets were sneaky little beads of possibilities that were ignored in life — on purpose or not — and didn’t like being overlooked. They still accompanied the souls onto their next lives, if said souls were deemed worthy of reincarnation.
The What ifs and Oh I wish Is made some of Jungkook’s cases very difficult to handle. Nothing he couldn’t get through though.
However, this time, something was wrong: It was an hour since Oh Hyejin died and she still had her memories. They were in the hospital poorly lit parking lot. The weather was cold, wind rustling tree leaves and rare passerbys. The Reaper and the soul didn’t feel it, though: the perks of being between life and death, Jungkook thought.
It was an hour since Oh Hyejin died and she still remembered her son. She perfectly recalled his name and hers, their address, the circumstances of her death. She was frantic, fumbling with her hands.
“You don’t understand, Jeoseungsaja-nim! He’s alone! He’s alone, hiding in that closet and he’d never go out of it if I don’t tell him to! He— I told you, he’s only seven! You can’t— I mean, he’s only seven!”
“I’m sure the detectives did their job and found him, Oh Hyejin-ssi.”
Jungkook knew that he wasn’t really believing it, when the words escaped his mouth. Maybe that was the reason Hyejin didn’t seem to believe him either.
“Then let me check! Just— I promise, I’ll do whatever you want after that, just— I need to see him! I need to tell him it’s okay and I need to— Yes, I just need to be sure he’s okay, please!”
The distress in her voice made Jungkook falter. Almost.
“Oh Hyejin-ssi, you’re dead. Even if you see him, you won’t be able to talk to him and he won’t be able to see you, you’re a soul, now. You don’t want to become a ghost.”
She looked at him, weary.
“Ghosts are souls that for a reason or another, find an anchor in the living world that makes it hard for them to leave,” Jungkook continued. “And, contrary to people’s beliefs, ghosts can’t haunt places, they only haunt people. But a soul is only the sum of its good and bad experiences, raw and primal. They get obsessed. They cling onto the object of their fixation and build walls around them. A haunted person will withdraw from the world, from life, because Death is clinging to them and therefore not really living. I’m sure you don’t want that for your son, don’t you?”
The more he talked, the more jittery Hyejin became. She was rubbing her hands against her arms now, her eyes lost somewhere behind him.
“But I just want to make sure he’s okay, I don’t want to haunt him! It won’t take long, I promise.”
Jungkook was beginning to lose his patience. He took Oh Hyejin’s arm, as gently as he could, and shook his head.
“We wasted enough time here, I need to get you to the—“
Hyejin struggled against his grip and, as she freed herself, began to run towards the exit of the parking lot. Jungkook wouldn't have cared at all — while flying, he knew he'd catch up to her in no time — if she hadn't... disappeared before his eyes. As if she had evaporated.
And no, that wasn't something souls were supposed to be able to do either.
The Reaper sat on the edge of one of the plant pots that framed the hospital doors. There was only soil and dead wrinkled branches on the pots, at this point. Jungkook sighed for what seemed to be the millionth time today. He closed his eyes and concentrated. He let his shoulders relax and focused on the light grip he felt on his wrist, the faint burn of the gray string that wrapped around his flesh and mentally pulled on it.
You see, humans had red strings that connected their birth to their ends, entangling themselves with each other along the way, creating knots and relationships, and fraying with every touch. But Reapers didn’t have that. They were immortal as long as they served Death, so they had no life strings. They did had acquaintences and friends and companions among other Reapers. Connections they chose along the way. And every time a genuine bond formed, a gray line connected their left wrists. That’s how Reapers communicated. 
They also had a black string, linking them to Death. It was used by the Dispatch Center to contact them, if needed.
So now, Jungkook was pulling on the gray one of his only two connections — the other one was black, hoping Hanee would answer rapidly.
“Oh, Kook! I was about to call you.”
As he heard the first words in his head, the gray thread shined and was no longer intangible nor invisible. Now, it was purring against Jungkook’s wrist and he couldn’t help but smile and tug at it a little bit harder.
“Noona! I’m sorry, I didn’t want to disturb you,” he spoke with a smile.
“No, I just got here, Kookie… How did it go with your case? Oh Hyejin-ssi, was it?”
“Mmmhhh not very well, I have to admit…”
“Is everything okay?”
“She disappeared.”
The silence was louder than any words Hanee could have uttered at that moment.
“She just vanished, Noona, right before my eyes.”
“Are you talking figuratively or—?” she asked, in a whisper.
“No, no,” Jungkook assured her. “It’s like she teleported or something.”
“Jungkook, souls can’t do that.”
“You don’t think I know that? This whole thing is weird, she’s been dead for an hour but still has all her memories.”
“Oh? That happens sometimes, but I’ve never heard of— wait, wasn’t that a double death?”
“Yes, she killed her father before dying, why?” Jungkook answered, hearing the sudden worry in Hanee’s voice.
“I haven’t heard about Chungho yet, he was dispatched to Dobong-gu, too, since every free Reaper from there is dealing with the gas leak.”
“Oh, how is it going, by the way?”
The explosion was the reason the Northern Dispatch Center allocated Reapers from neighboring districts to Dobong-gu and the reason Jungkook had to work overtime in an unfamiliar neighborhood.
“Too much souls to gather and guide and they’re still cautious so no one becomes a vengeful spirit…”, answered Hanee, some kind of emotion in her voice.
“I see,” Jungkook whispered. 
It was sad they couldn’t do anything about it but Jungkook understood long ago that it wasn’t his role to save people. He couldn’t save everyone, his only duty was to guide some of them to the Gates of the Afterlife.
“How are you gonna find Oh Hyejin, then?” Hanee asked.
“Oh, I know where she went, so…”
“Oh Hyejin-ssi is you client until she crosses the Gates of the Afterlife,” Hanee reminded him. “The originally assigned Reaper can’t work on this case anymore since it became yours. So, please don’t do anything stupid, I don’t want Ryu Asshole thinking we can’t handle a job, please!”
Ryu Asshole’s real name was Ryu Donghwan and he was the Chief Reaper of Yongsan. Jungkook met him enough times to really dislike the man: he always bragged about his district being the best one or about handling famous people’s cases. And when he didn’t do that, he took every opportyunity to belittle the districts on the outskirts.
Hanee hated him.
“Yah, Noona, I’m offended, really! When have I ever not handled a job?” Jungkook sulked.
“Don’t ‘yah’ at me, you scoundrel! Just be careful, okay?”
Jungkook smiled. Lee Hanee was a delight and probably his only friend, even if he didn’t knew if he could use that word. She was the Chief of the Gangbuk-gu district and had fiery temperament. But she loved her team and made sure they were always taken care of.
“Yes, yes, I’ll be careful. Gotta go, now! I’ll see you later!”
The gray thread stopped shining, became lifeless again when the connection broke, and Jungkook opened his eyes.
Then he spread his wings and took off.

Jungkook meets Yoongi
The flight wasn’t long, it took him less than 10 minutes to get to Oh Hyejin’s apartment. He just hoped she was where he supposed she was.
He landed before a small two-stories red-bricked building. The street was poorly lit but Jungkook could see that the second floor was empty, like most of the surrounding buildings. There was trash bags pretty much everywhere and an old car was parked in the corner. Nothing really special, in itself, except for the yellow police tape barring the entrance which, surprisingly, blended into the surrounding setting.
He climbed the few stairs that led to the apartment door. They were topped with dust-covered plastic flower pots and some persistent weeds. Without opening the door, he entered the house and immediately, the smell made him wrinkle his nose. Jungkook wasn’t bothered though. All his senses were dulled so unless it was some unbearable smell or taste, he didn’t feel it. 
He ignored the bloodied floor, dotted with glass shards and black footprints — probably made by the detectives, and headed to the lightly opened door at their left from where he could hear pained sobs.
“He’s in there”, Hyejin sniffled. She was sitting on the floor, looking at the closet’s door, when Jungkook entered the room. “Under one of my coats, probably… He— I think he likes the smell of my clothes…”
Jungkook’s heart sank a bit.
“I can’t open the door, and the closet is too small for me to enter,” she continued.
Slowly, Hyejin stood up and moved forward to open the closet but she couldn't grab the handle, her hand slipping completely through it. 
“I called him but he can’t hear me… You said you wouldn’t interfere but… It means you can, right?” she asked Jungkook, hopeful.
“No!”, Jungkook answered, firm. “No, absolutely not!”
“We would only open the closet door!”, Hyejin pleaded.
“I told you, we can’t and this is—“, Jungkook began.
“My son is alone, confined in a closet, and scared!”
“There are rules and we can’t break them, this is my final answer!”, Jungkook yelled, angrily.
“And I don’t care!” Hyejin was screaming now too. “Please, please, help me,” she then pleaded with a softer voice.
Of course, Jungkook broke rules before. When he was still alive and stupid. And even in death, once. And every single time, he paid the price. So he knew now that the rules were there for a reason: to ensure everything would be okay, to make the line between good and bad clear. And it’s not like Hyejin was asking him something simple, because Death only had two Unbreakable Commandment for his Reapers:
1. To not interfere in a living person’s life or death
2. To never reveal one’s existence to a living person
So, at that moment, for Jungkook, it wasn’t just about opening the closet. If they found the boy then he would have to do something about it and explain to him that he had to keep his existence a secret. Surely, there was another way to check if the boy was still there? Another way to help him without involving himself too much?
He wanted to help, he really did.
“I’m— I’m really sorry, Hye—“
“Ahjussi, who are you?”
Jungkook and Hyejin both turned to face the closet again but, now, an ebony black haired little guy was peaking through the door. Jungkook frowned. He wasn’t supposed to be able to see them.
Hyejin was the first to break the stunned silence: “Adeul…?”
But the little boy didn’t even give his mother a look. He only tilted his head and blinked, his eyes glued on Jungkook.
“You can see me,” the Reaper exhaled.
“Of course, I can see you, ahjussi… Are you a friend of my eomma? Is— Is she okay?”
Hyejin let out a sob and collapsed on the ground, hitting her chest with her fisted hand.
“Oh, my Yoongi, my precious…”
Jungkook was still processing how the boy was able to see him. Only him. He couldn’t wrap his mind around it… Comforting Hyejin didn’t even occur to him. But when he heard someone pick the front door’s lock, he snapped out of it. 
He heard of some crime scenes being visited by thieves and he didn’t want the boy to get hurt. And it’s not like he chose to meddle: the boy could see him already, it was too late to do something about it and too early to think about the consequences.
The only thing that somewhat reassured him was that no other Reaper was at the scene and that only meant that no-one was to die, tonight. Well, no-one else. So Jungkook stuck his head through the door to gauge his opponents. And what he saw made him smile. He went into the room again, ignored Hyejin’s silent sobs and crouched in front of the little Yoongi so their eyes could be at the same level. Then he smiled, as reassuringly as he could. 
“Yoongi, listen to me…”
Now, there were muffled voices coming from the living room. The kid, who had his gaze on the slightly opened door, the hand he had clenched around the closet door shaking a little, turned to him.
“Go back to the closet and don’t make a sound, okay?”
“O-okay”, Yoongi whispered.
Yoongi only had the time to close the door on him that the bedroom’s door flew open. Hyejin was already in front of the closet door, her cheeks wet, guarding it like her life depended on it, glaring at the intruder.
Jungkook stood there, completely stunned, because he already made a decision: He was going to protect Yoongi. He still wasn’t sure of how to act on it, though… He was going to protect him even if the greatest crime was preventing someone's death. Even if it cost him his job, his Reaper status… Even if it was going to upset and disappoint Hanee — which was, by far, the consequence he feared the most.
The light came on and pulled Jungkook out of his thoughts. 
“What kind of burglars turns out the light?”, he whispered to himself.
Probably the kind that’s not here to steal, a voice answered in his head.
“Yoongi, don’t answer me but you don’t have to be afraid of the people here, they’re here to help you,” Jungkook finally said out loud, knowing only Hyejin and Yoongi could hear him. “Just… Don’t tell them you saw me, okay?”
Because Jungkook figured it out: the stranger had broad shoulders, fluffy brown hair and kind hazel eyes. And the Reaper was sure that, if he spoke, his voice would be deep and velvety.
Like a summer storm.
Doctor Kim Taehyung was indeed beautiful.

Taehyung was trying to even his breathing but without much success. Crying, heaving really, under the hot stream of the shower, his body felt numb, like it wasn't his own anymore.His heart, though... His heart felt too much, too quickly, too intensively. 
That was probably the reason he never could detach himself enough, keep a distance with his patients. For whatever he did, Taehyung always invested himself entirely, even if there was nothing left of him at the end. 
Some days, he really felt like he wasn't cut for the job.
He loved it, though, with all the fibers of his being. He loved knowing he helped people, gave someone a few more years with their loved ones.
He burns himself with the robinet


When he began to 






Taehyung is pissed. He takes off his gloves, his gown, his mask, shoves them angerily onto the bin. He then proceeds to scrub his hands when Doctor Hwang joins him.
She doesn’t say anything but maybe it’s because the tension in the room is palpable and Hwang Miyoung have known Taehyung for far too long to know this isn’t the right time.
Taehyung goes then to the front desk. The detectives are long gone but the police officers are still there. He walks to them, almost stomping.
“She- Oh Hyejin-ssi. She didn’t make it.”
The officers look at him, indifferent.
“Thanks for letting us know, doctor,” one of them bows.
Then they turn around to head out.
“Does she have any family?” Taehyung couldn’t help but ask. He felt hot, lightheaded. One of the officer turns to him while the other goes through the doors.
“No, Detective Shin said that she only had her father but she killed him, so…”
Taehyung nods then turns around to head to the changing room. But he hears one of the nurses — she joined the staff recently, Taehyung thinks — asking Do Minjun, the head nurse.
“They’re Oh Hyejin’s things…”
“Didn’t Yuna-ssi already explain to you what to do with this stuff?”
“Not really, I-“
“Can I look at them?”, asked Taehyung.
Taehyung knows his behaviour is weird. He don’t need Minjun’s raised eyebrows to understand that. But something… Something is itching him. He feels like he’s missing something. 
“Of course”, the nurse says finally.
Taehyung approches and only finds a ring — it seems cheap — and a phone. Both are smeared with blood. He tries to unlock the phone but he can’t: there’s a password. The phone screen is of the deceased woman and a little boy. He looks a lot like her, his skin way fairer than hers but with the same little cat-like eyes.
It hits Taehyung, then. He saw a C-section’s scar on Oh Hyejin’s body — a not very well done one at that, if he recalls correctly. 
“Minjun-ah, did the detectives say anything about her kid?”
“Her kid? I don’t think so… I mean, why would-“
Taehyung drops the phone on the counter, fishes his own phone from his pocket and heads to the changing room.
Nurse Do will probably scold him tomorrow for his rudeness but he’ll deal with that later.
He knows it’s probably nothing. She could have lost the baby. She could had put him up to adoption. The boy on her screen might be a distant relative.
Or he could be her son. And he could be alone right now, having lost the last two members of his family.
“Tae-“
“Hyung, I need a favour.”
On his way to the changing room, he had called his older brother, Namjoon. It was past midnight but if Taehyung was a workaholic, his condition was child’s play compared to Namjoon. He knew the older would be up and working — because when was he not?
“Hello to you too, Taetaebear!”
Taehyung didn’t even bother telling his brother not to call him like that. He simply—
“And don’t roll your eyes! Have some respect for your elders, would you?!”
“Hyung, it’s serious, I really need a favour!”
“Shoot!”
“There’s this girl… She— She died on my table, tonight and- i- it’s stupid but I just want to be sure, you know? There’s nothing on her records but she- I mean-“

“Tae? Breathe!”

“Okay, okay…”

He took a few seconds to even his breath and sort his thoughts.

“She has a c-section scar but the detectives say she has no family… But her phone screen is a picture of her and a little boy, I just want to make sure, you know?”

Namjoon didn’t say anything at first. He knew why his little brother was freaking out. And Taehyung was grateful because Namjoon never judged him. Even now, where all he had was a hunch.

“What’s her name?”

Taehyung heard a rumbling, papers being moved around and the sound of someone typing swiftly on a keyboard.

“Oh Hyejin, she’s 24. She’s… was- She was only 24.”

He only mumbled the last words but Namjoon still didn’t comment. That was the 12th name on Taehyung’s list. The list of people whose names would always be carved on his memory. The list of people he couldn’t save. The list of the names of his guilt.

He put Namjoon on speaker so he can change into his jean and a hoodie.

“Okay, I’ve got a Oh Hyejin, 24, living on Dobong-gu with her father… Her mum apparently died five years ago… Mmmmhh… Oh?”

Taehyung wasn’t hearing anything anymore from the other side of the line.

“Hyung?”

He was putting on his shoes now.

“Oh? Oh! Yeah… Her mum apparently adopted a little boy but there’s nothing more on him like… He’s… seven. That’s weird- I mean- Usually, the paperwork… Who’s the detective in charge? They didn’t found the boy in the house?”

Taehyung put the phone back on his ear. 

“Hyung, please, give me her address, I’m heading there, right now!”

“Taehyung, I can’t give you her address, just like that!”

“Okay, I’m going to look into her personal file then-“

It wasn’t really illegal. But he could get into trouble…

“No”, Namjoon interrupted him. “I’ll send you her address, just don’t break into her house, I’m going there right now, wait for me!”

“Hyung, he might be-“

“Tae, no.”

Namjoon wasn’t shouting but Tae would never dare answer back when he used this particular voice. He knew his brother was serious.

“It’s going to take me 45 mns or an hour, but I’m going to be there! Do not enter the house, is that clear?”

“Yes, Hyung…”

Namjoon hung up and Taehyung put on his long dark gray coat and headed to his car. He put the address Namjoon texted him on the car GPS: it would only take him 10 minutes to get to Oh Hyejin’s house. He started the car.

Taehyung hated driving. Every time he could, he took the bus but it was raining hard this afternoon so he took the car. He hated driving because it left him alone with his thoughts. And he didn’t want to be alone with his thoughts. Never. And especially not right now. He really hoped he was mistaking about the boy. Losing his family like this was horrible, Taehyung knew something about it. He also knew about being left alone in a house — no, a crime scene.

Taehyung was seven years old when his father died because of him. He still remembered the stench of blood, the muffled screams and his father's eyes, usually filled with warmth and life slowly, sadly dying out. 

It was stupid, really: they were vacationing in Ulsan for a week because Taehyung had never seen the sea before. But he fell ill before the end of their stay and his father decided to return earlier to Daegu so he can take better care of his son. On the night of their return, they were still standing on the front yard when his father noticed that the door was not closed and that there was noises coming from the inside. He crouched before Taehyung and made him promise to hide in the garden shed and not to make any sound.

Apparently, the burglar panicked and stabbed the house owner.

After what seemed like hours, he left his shelter, opened the front door a crack and found his father lying on the ground in a pool of blood. He remembered not feeling anything at all and not really understanding what was happening. He knew, of course, that things were bad, that something was wrong without grasping the horrible nature of what had happened. He just knelt in front of his father's body and hugged him. Tight.

Shivering at the cold touch of his father’s skin against his.

He was found a day later, in the same position, asleep. When he woke up, when that police officer explained to him that his father whom he adored would never come back, Taehyung remembered feeling very guilty, not really knowing why. After years of therapy, Taehyung knew that he felt guilty because if he thought that if he hadn't been sick, they wouldn't have come back sooner. If he hadn't been hiding in the shed in the garden, his father wouldn't have entered their damned house. If he had kept his promise to remain hidden, his father would not have died.

Of course, today, Taehyung was aware of the absurdity of this reasoning. That still didn't stop him from feeling extremely guilty, even now. Besides, because of these events, at the time, he hadn't spoken for more than two years... Until Jin, his big brother, snapped him out of his silence.

Taehyung shook his head and the memories jostling in it and constricting his throat. Taehyung didn't like to remember this whole story, of course. A sense of dread clenched his heart at the thought that someone could be living something similar and his knuckles were white on the steering wheel.

He arrived and waited half an hour with his toughts, fighting the urge to barge in that house — Taehyung didn’t even know which one exactly but did it matter? Anything was better than sitting idle.

Big decision

Someone tapped on his car window and Taehyung jumped. Namjoon's concern could be read on his face despite the small smile drawn on his lips. He didn't say a word, except a little "Let's go!" accompanied by a nod towards one of the buildings behind him. Taehyung got out of his car, locked it, and silently followed his brother.

The apartment was tiny. It had a small kitchen open onto the living room. There was no couch and no tv, just a kitchen table with empty soju bottles. Taehyung noticed two plastic bags on the floor, one with a styrofoam container and the other had a little box and some candles. 

The foul smell that attacked his nostrils threatened to bring back some memories and he closed his eyes tight, tight, to keep them from overwhelming him. Now was definitely not the time.

There was a door to the left and a corridor ahead of them with two more doors and, to Taehyung relief, no sign of a kid living here: no toys, no games, no children books... Only blood and glass shards and tape on the floor.

Namjoon headed to the corridor.

“Look into this room, okay? And be careful!”, he whispered, pointing to the door at the left.

Taehyung nodded and entered the designated room. It was as cluttered as the rest of the apartment but it was way cleaner. There was still no toys and no books and a sense of relief began to wash over him: maybe he was wrong and there was no kid in here… But Taehyung realized there was no pictures and no personal items either. It felt like a tacky motel room, a temporary stay. 

Definitely not a home. 

He turned the light then crouched and looked under the bed: nothing.

He headed to the far left closet and opened it and, again, found nothing. He was going to close the closet door to open the other one when he heard something. Behind the hanged long coats and pants, there was the sound of a little whimper. Taehyung crouched again and slowly, carefully, moved the coats. His eyes landed then on a little boy who was closing his own and had one of his hands on his mouth, probably to lessen any sound he could make.

He was squeezing  his phone with the other one. Hard. Taehyung extended his hand to pat the kid on the head but he didn’t get to: the boy opened his eyes and stared at Taehyung like, suddenly, he wasn’t at all afraid anymore.

“Hi, there!”

The boy looked at him. No, he was observing him. At least, that’s how Taehyung felt: examined. Taehyung smiled at him.

“My name is Taehyung and I- I’m-“

Taehyung didn’t want to lie. But how could he explain anything to a seven year old?

“I’m here to help you”, he finished. “You’re Yoongi, isn’t it?”

“Where’s eomma?”, the boy asked. “Is she okay?”

Taehyung’s throat tightened. 

“Not really…”

“She’s hurt, isn’t she? Are you a policeman?”

“No but my brother is, he’s in the next room…”

“It’s that bad, huh…?”

Yoongi didn’t sound like a seven year old at all. Somehow, it made Taehyung want to smile but also to hug and protect the little thing.

“When can I see her?”

It wasn’t a question about if he could see his mother but about when. And something about the certainty in his eyes, his assurance that he was going to see his mother again made Taehyung want to swallow his tears and show a little more courage. 

As a doctor, he had to break down bad news to a lot of his patients, already. He was familiar with it. 

“Always say things firmly, take the time to state the facts, show empathy and be ready to answer questions”, said Jimin when Taehyung was still a resident. But being familiar with the exercice didn’t make it any easier. And this was a kid!

“Yoongi, I want you to listen closely, okay?”

The boy nodded.

“Something happened to your mum and she- she died. I’m so sorry, Yoongi.”

“Oh.”

Beside his knuckles tightening more around his phone, nothing changed in Yoongi’s behaviour. Maybe he didn’t really understand death. Or maybe he was in shock. Or maybe-

“And harabeoji?”

Yoongi’s voice was calm.

“He’s- actually, he’s dead too…”

“I see.”

Yoongi’s breath was getting shorter. 

“Yoongi, I’m here to help you, okay? I need you to trust me right now, I’m going to help you, no matter what, okay? Can you trust me?”

A pout on his rosy lips, small beads of tears at the corner of his eyes and clinging to his long eyelashes, the little boy nodded.

“Okay, we’re going to play a game, okay? I need to know how much time you can go without opening your eyes, understood?”

A new brief nod.

“Close your eyes now and count, don’t open them until I tell you, okay?”

Yoongi closed his eyes and started counting. Taehyung got up, took a cream-colored sweater from the closet, something that definitely belonged to Oh Hyejin. Then Taehyung squatted more, wrapped the hoodie around Yoongi’s head and scooped him up gently. Yoongi buried his button nose onto Taehyung’s neck. The doctor stood up again and left the room.

“17… 18…”

“I didn’t find- Oh!”

That was Namjoon, who was coming back from the other room, too. Yoongi turned his head to see but Tae put his left hand on his head and brought it back to his neck, preventing him from seeing the horror around them.

“Continue counting, okay? Don’t open your eyes!”

Namjoon and Taehyung, with Yoongi in his arms, made it out of the house.

“I’m calling the Child Protection Agency, wait here, okay?”, Namjoon whispered, already looking through his phone.

“Hyung, I saw a convenience store on the way, I’m going to take him there…”

Namjoon only nodded, his phone already glued to his ear.

“89… 90…”.

Yoongi was still counting, his warm breath tickling Taehyun’s neck. The doctor held the boy firmly against him and hurried — without running — to the 24/7 convenience store.

“162… 163…”

“Yoongi? You can open your eyes!”

Yoongi did and peaked from under his mother’s hoodie. Taehyung made him sit on the customer’s counter in front of the window and helped him put the hoodie on, above his white shirt and light jean vest. The hoodie was so big on him, it fell onto the boy’s knees. Taehyung mentally slapped his head mentally, when he noticed that the little boy was still in socks.

“You must be hungry! Do you want to eat something? Ahjussi’s treat!”

Yoongi looked at him briefly then at the floor, his little feet dangling above the stool.

“A tuna triangle gimbap?”

“Tuna triangle gimbap it is! Do you want banana milk too?”

“No, choco!”

“Okay, we’ll just wait for my brother to come, okay?”

“Okay…”

At the same time, Namjoon entered the convenience store, a small coat and shoes on his hands.

“Thought they might be useful”, he told a smiling with relief Taehyung. 

Then, with a warm dimpled smile, Namjoon bended to be on Yoongi’s eye level.

“Hi! My name is Namjoon, I am Taehyung’s older brother, nice to meet you!”

He held out his hand and Yoongi observed it.

“Can I see your badge?”

“How do you- Oh! Okay…”

Namjoon smile widened and he smacked his left hand onto the one that was held — the one Yoongi ignored — then fished out for his badge. Yoongi took the time to read it. Then, after returning the badge, he, held out his own little hand to Namjoon.

“My name is Min Yoongi, nice to meet you, Detective Kim Namjoon of Seocho Police Station.”

Namjoon shook Yoongi’s hand.

“Hyung, he’s hungry, I’m going to buy him a meal, do you want something too?”

“Are you treating?”

“No…”

“Mmhh… Then Yukgeajang cup ramyeon and triangle kimbap?”

“Why do I have the feeling that that’s what you ate the three last meals?”

“Don’t judge, not everyone here is a rich ass doctor!”

“Hyung, language!”

Namjoon side eyed Yoongi who was watching them intently.

“Sorry, kid…”

“It’s okay, detective… »

Namjoon smiled at him, apologetically, and Taehyung went to prepare a meal for them. He ended up buying a lot more than the two others asked and by the time he came back, Yoongi had his shoes on and Namjoon was showing him his handcuffs.

“It’s pretty cool, huh? You wanna be a detective, when you grow up?”

“No.”

Namjoon choked on his own saliva and Taehyung refrained a laugh.  He wished he was as sure of anything in his life as Yoongi was now with his career choice not being a police officer, as it was apparent in the way he spoke. Namjoon’s smile that faltered a few seconds prior, lighted up again at the sight of food when Taehyung put the ramyeon and kimbap on the counter. Taehyung chuckled: Namjoon was truly a simple man.

“What do you want to be when you grow up, then?”, Taehyung asked.

Yoongi opened up his kimbap with expert hands while Namjoon ripped the plastic wrap and the nori sheet with it, putting rice everywhere. Tae wasn’t hungry but Namjoon had opened some nori flavoured puff stars chips and he picked one.

“An astronaut”, Yoongi answered.

Taehyung smiled and Namjoon whistled, clearly impressed.

“So you’re into space, huh?”, Namjoon asked and slurped his very hot ramyeon, wincing in pain.
But before Yoongi could answer, the bell of the convenience store door rang again and a very pretty woman, dressed in pretty sharp red stilettos and a bespoke little black dress under a dark loose coat entered and headed towards them. An ahjumma soon followed, a briefcase full of paper under her right arm.
“Hi!”
The young woman was pretty with her lightly tanned skin, her jet black hair and her small face. But she exhuded this aura of confidence that really made her shine. She looked so out of place under the harsh lights of the convenience store. The older had crow's feet at the corners of her eyes that widened even more when she smiled. She was dressed simply but elegantly, and an air of benevolence emanated from her.
Yoongi observed them attentively, munching on his kimbap while Namjoon almost choked on his noodles.
“Huiyeon-ah!”
He took some tissues and wiped his hands while swallowing and then he stood up, and smiled at the women.
“Thanks for coming!”
“It’s nothing, thank you for telling me, too,” the young one — Huiyeon — said. “This is Mrs. Choi Sejong, she works with me for the Child Care Services but this is her district, so I called her.”
Namjoon bowed to the woman while giving her his card.
“Nice to meet, mrs. Choi,” he said.
Huiyeon’s sharp features softened when a genuine smile clung onto her lips, the moment her eyes landed on the boy.
“You must be Yoongi!”
“Are you a detective too?” the boy asked.
“Mmhhh, not really, my job is to help little boys like you,” she answered with a driven voice.
“It seems like it’s everyone’s job, here”, Yoongi replied, stoic. He then proceeded to gulp the last bite of his kimbap, his eyes not leaving the pretty lady.
Taehyung and Huiyeon looked at him.
“How old are you, again?”
Yoongi took the time to swallow and put down the empty kimbap package before answering: “I am seven, it’s my birth— what time is it?”
His eyes darted towards Taehyung, one eyebrow higher than the other.
“Almost 2 am“, Taehyung answered, after a brief look onto his watch.
“My birthday was yesterday, then… I just turned eight.”
A beat of silence.
“Joonie, can I talk to you?”, asked the woman.

Namjoon cheeks became pink and he ignored the raised eyebrows of Taehyung. He just followed Huiyeon.

“Finish you choco milk, okay?”, Taehyun said, a hand caressing Yoongi’s head. “Are you still hungry? Ahjussi can buy you more snacks, if you w-“

“Ahjussi…”

“Yes, buddy?”

“Am I going to die, too?”

“What?”

His lower lips was trembling and his gaze was somewhat lost in front of him. Taehyung wanted to hug him, reassure him that everything was going to be okay… He could only imagine the storm of thoughts that must be unfolding in his head, right now.

“We all die, one day, buddy… But it’s not your time yet, okay?”

“Where will I go, now?”

“I- I don’t know…”

That was a lie. Taehyung was familiar with the National Child Protection Agency, the constant move from a family to another and the orphanage common rooms in between. He knew. And he didn’t want this little guy to go through with it.

“Tae!”, Namjoon called him.

“I’m coming back, okay? Finish your choco milk!”

He then turned around as soon as Yoongi nodded and went to Namjoon and Huiyeon-ssi.

“Okay so Huiyeon-ah says she can’t do much until the morning… She already tried to contact an emergency foster family but there was a gas leak explosion in Dobong-gu, so they’re full. She will try to find out who the father is or if his mother had any distant relatives that would take Yoongi on. Until then, you- you know the drill… He-“

“No.”

Huiyeon and Namjoon looked at him. Taehyung only turned around slightly to look at Yoongi who was now eating seaweed flavoured puffed stars. He knew that was he was going to say was crazy. He didn’t even knew if he could do it… No, he could! He was going to do it! It wasn’t going to be easy but he didn’t want Yoongi to go through it. He was bright and smart and Taehyung could help. He wanted to help.

“I’m- He’s going with me.”

Silence. Then, Huiyeon started talking: “Taehyung-ssi, this is not-“

“I know, Huiyeon-ssi, believe me, I know! But I’m a doctor, I have an apartment and I can provide for him. Only until you find his father or his relatives, okay? I’m just helping him, while you look for his family.”

Huiyeon looked at him intently then raised an eyebrow at Namjoon.

“He- He’s my little brother, I can vouch for him?”

She turned to Taehyung again: “Sorry but, Taehyung-ssi, you’re not a registered foster family, so we can’t-“

“We can.”

He finally fixed his gaze on Huiyeon again.

“We can. I can provide you with every single document or proof you want… Hell, you can even go with me right now and inspect my apartment — which has 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms and a study with extra bedding… Please, Huiyeon-ssi, do whatever you need to, but… Let me help.”

He looked at her, fire in his eyes melting all the woman’s uncertainties.

“He’s coming with me.”

Inside the convenience store, not far away from where they stood, Jungkook observed the trio. At the doctor's surprising announcement to take Yoongi to his home and take care of him, something in Jungkook's heart ached. Kim Taehyung was intriguing: he had known Yoongi for less than a hour and yet he just decided to take responsibility till the end. Either he was totally unaware of what this responsibility represented. Or he was the most selfless person Jungkook had ever seen. Doctors who fight for their patients, who go beyond their simple job of caring for people, Jungkook had seen a lot of them, of course. It took a minimum of empathy and selflessness to do this kind of job, after all, Jungkook thought. But Doctor Kim Taehyung went way beyond that and the Reaper didn't know what to think of that.
Before he could indulge more in his thoughts, a wave of negative and deeply intertwined emotions but wrapped in sheer anger washed over him. Jungkook frowned: it was definitely not his own emotions. He looked in all directions but apart from the four people to his right who were discussing the details of what they were going to do, watching the child from afar, Hyejin behind him, drowning in a sense of relief, Yoongi who was dozing off and the cashier who was too focused on his homework, there was no one in the convenience store. Jungkook really hoped to be wrong and that what he felt was just a figment of his imagination. Because the only thing that could explain this phenomenon did not presage anything good and he absolutely did not want to think about it. 
It disappeared pretty quickly, though, so Jungkook chose to believe it was nothing.
Still, he turned to Hyejin, a little sharp: "Come on, Hyejin-ssi!"
"Now?" she asked.
“You should have passed the Gates of the Arterlife at least two hours ago! Clearly, you saw for yourself that your son is in good hands!"
"But he's a stranger, if only I could—"
"What? If only you could what? Go to his house? Make sure he takes care of Yoongi? And what next? Wait until they find him a suitable foster family? Or until he’s adopted? Or until he graduate??"
Jungkook was fed up and clearly tired. He ran a hand over his face and pinched the bridge of his nose between his index finger and his thumb.
"No one will care for Yoongi as good as you did, Oh Hyejin-ssi. No one will love him more than you loved him! You’re his mother! But Doctor Kim Taehyung seems to care. A lot. And Yoongi will be fine, I can promise you! I promise you I will be here for him and protect him if needed."
"But-"
"I know, I told you I can't interfere but for him… for me, I will. Remember what I told you about clinging to a living person?"
Hyejin nodded then seemed to take a decision.
"Understood. Let me just—"
Jungkook nodded and Hyejin approached Yoongi and tried to caress his cheek but her hand went through Yongi's body making him shiver. Hyejin, on the other hand, withdrew her hand as if it hurt her, a grimace of pain on her face.
"My son, my treasure, my baby… I have to go now but please, don't forget your eomma loved you with all the fibers of her being until her last breath and even beyond death. I love you! I love you so much and I’m sorry I couldn’t protect you… Make sure to grow up well, okay? See you in your next life, my baby."
She was crying, now, observing the little boy whose head was dangling from sleep like she was trying to commit every one of his feature to memory. She kept trying to touch him and changing her mind at the last moment.
After what seemed like an eternity to Jungkook, Hyejin finally took her eyes off of Yoongi and turned back to face the Reaper, sobbing heavily.
It was at that moment that Jungkook heard it first: a low and foreboding growl. The feeling of anger intensified and seemed to be coming from the far right corner of the store. Jungkook couldn’t see anything there, but it was a dark spot, and there were ELEPHANT étalage that hid une bonne partie. 
Jungkook looked briefly at Hyejin to make sure she wasn’t going to disappear on him, while he investigated the weird energy but the mother and the son were both alert, now, frowning at the corner, like they could hear the growl or feel the anger, too. Which wouldn’t even be the weirdest thing about the duo, at this point of the night, Jungkook decided. Doctor Kim and the other three humans with him were now walking back to the little boy. Jungkook just shrugged and focused his attention back on the energy at his left. 
Approchant doucement, ses pas aussi légers que possible. Arrivé au bout du rayon, il baissa la tête pour regarder à travers les étalages de couches pour bébé et vit quelque chose qui lui retourna l’estomac: it was definitely some kind of spirit, it had the same glowing aura than Oh Hyejin, but it was anything but human. It was tall and skinny, had an emaciated face, barely recognizable and very hollow features, no eyes and a permanent grimace of rage. His feet and hands resembled human feet and hands only narrower, longer and dotés de griffes. The spirit was on his four members but his neck was short and looked like it wasn’t made for the creature to hold that position naturally, so his neck had a very weird angle. Very weird and very wrong. Jungkook had been a Reaper for more than 700 years but he never saw anything like it. 
D’un air féroce, une haine féroce émanant d’elle, la créature regardait Yoongi et grognait de plus en plus fort. Jungkook regarda derrière lui: Hyejin regardait avec horreur la créature tandis que Yoongi semblait confus, comme s’il arrivait à entendre les grognements mais il regardait un peu partout, comme pour localiser d’où ils venaient.
A streak of colors and anger passed so close to Jungkook that he didn't realize until too late what was happening: Hyejin was held down on the ground, the creature’s teeth clasped on her neck. Her feet moved according to the movements she was making in order to free herself, while the spirit was holding her down hard. 
Her eyes were filled with pure fear.
Yoongi, his hands on his ears was screaming now, four adults trying to understand what was happening to him. 
Jungkook didn’t have time to listen to what they thought was happening, he flicked his wrist to the side and his weapon appeared in a shower of purple sparks. He snapped his whip chain and threw it in a quick, precise motion which caused it to wrap around the figure's ankle. He pulled hard and it knocked the thing off balance. Hyejin screamed, as the creature’s nails dessinèrent des sillons sur une de ses jambes, and immediately put her hands around her neck, while coughing and trying to catch her breath. The dark creature quickly freed itself from Jungkook's chain, stood up and when it faced him, the Reaper cursed. 

The thing screeched and Jungkook couldn't help but wince at the inhuman sound that escaped from the creature’s toothless mouth. From the corner of his eyes, Jungkook saw Yoongi’s body go lax in Doctor Kim’s arms. 
As quickly as it appeared, it then disappeared. Jungkook rushed over to Hyejin, knelt down in front of her then put a hand on her knee.
"Are you okay?"
Hyejin’s eyes were as wide as saucers. And when she spoke, her voice was hoarse, broken.
"What-cough, cough, what was that?"
"I don’t— I don’t know," Jungkook answered truthfully.
Jungkook’s guess was that it was Hyejin's father but he couldn't find the courage to tell her. He knew then that even if his promise to protect Yoongi was sincere earlier, he probably should take it more seriously now because with Hyejin gone, and if not caught very soon, the dark spirit would target Yoongi.
"What did it attack Yoongi?"
"I- I don’t know.”
It was a lie.
“Let's go, Hyejin-ssi! We really have to get to the Lighthouse now."




Before Jungkook could do something foolish like approach it further, elle se mit sur ses deux pieds — pattes arrières — pour prendre son élan et bondit en avant. Jungkook regarda avec horreur comment en deux bonds, elle allait être sur l’enfant.





She crossed the intersection and refused to look towards the convenience store.
“Where to, now?” Hyejin asked, sniffling.
"We're going to the—"
A streak of colors and anger passed so close to Jungkook that he didn't realize until too late what was happening: Hyejin was held down three feet from the ground, pressed against the iron gate of what appeared to be a fashion boutique. A silhouette held her by the neck and her feet moved according to the movements she was making in order to free herself.

Junkook flicked his wrist to the side and his weapon appeared in a shower of purple sparks. He snapped his whip chain and threw it in a quick, precise motion which caused it to wrap around the figure's ankle. He pulled hard and it knocked the thing off balance. Hyejin fell down and immediately put her hands around her neck, while coughing and trying to catch her breath. The dark creature quickly freed itself from Jungkook's chain, stood up and when it faced him, the Reaper cursed: it had an emaciated face, barely recognizable and very hollow features, no eyes and a permanent grimace of rage. 
This was what he feared: a vengeful spirit.

"Noona!"
"Kook, I was about to call you!"
Jungkook nervousness made him pace around, running his hands through his hair. And Hanee's tone only amplified his anxiety.
They were in the Lighthouse. This one looked like an old library, walls padded in bookcases, comfortable purple chairs scattered here and there. At the far left corner, on Jungkook’s right, there was a small counter behind which a young and beautiful bartender was preparing a cocktail.
Hyejin was sitted on a chair, near the entrance, the one they came from. She seemed euphoric but not really there, as she was nursing a light pink beverage. With how the candles’ lights reflected on the drink, it looked like some fancy rosé. She looked at everything with indefinite wonder in her eyes.
"Ahhh... I get you already know about the vengeful spirit then..."
"How— You encountered it?" Hanee asked, even more alarmed.
"Yeah… It attacked my Client. A heads-up would've been nice…"
There was no reproach in Jungkook's voice. He knew the situation must probably be hectic with the Gangbuk-gu District Team taking over Dobong-gu's cases.
"I'm really sorry, Kook… I was informed literally seconds ago and all my team is calling the other dispatched Reapers as we are speaking."
"I hope everyone's okay," he whispered.
"Believe me, someone is gonna lose their head if one of my team is hurt! But at least, we know who the spirit could be, if it attacked your Client!"
"Yes! I'm pretty sure the vengeful spirit was her father…"
She chuckled.
"I can't believe we managed to handle a gas leak explosion with no vengeful spirit nor egg spirit but a simple soul escorting went haywire like this! Haneul-ah!”, her voice sounded muffled now and Jungkook knew she was talking to Kang Haneul, the most efficient Dispatcher of the team. “Who handled um…", it looked like she was typing something on a keyboard, now. "Oh Seung… Oh Seungok-ssi's case?"
Then a few seconds and more hushed voices later: "Really? Why hasn't he called yet?"
Her voice was angry but then softened suddenly.
"Ah, Haneul-ah! Call him! Maybe he's injured? I swear on Shin Samang-nim’s name if that's the case, I'm going to murder him!"
"N—Noona! I—", Jungkook hesitated. 
"Oh! Kook, sorry…", her voice was clear and soft again. "It’s Chungho who handled your client’s father’s case and he hasn’t returned yet. But, go ahead, you're probably on your way to the Lighthouse now."
"Ah! Actually, I'm there already. Oh Hyejin-ssi is having an Oblivion Drink because she still has all her memories.”
"Ah! You did well, Kook-ah!"
"Noona, now that Oh Hyejin-ssi is going to cross the Gates of the Afterlife— that thing… It’s gonna target her son."
“Haneul-ah! Any news on Chungho?"
A beat later.
"Fuck! Send an intervention team there… No, one of ours... Yah! I don't care right now if we dont have the right to send people there without that prick's authorization! I'll handle the administrative shit later… Kook, can you handle it?? I mean the vengeful spirit. Reaper Lee isn’t answering."
"Yeah, of course, Noona! I still have to escort Oh Hyejin’s soul, first, though."
"Yes, of course! Haneul-ah, call and get me an appointment with Chief Jang, as soon as possible! Kook, be careful please, okay??"
"Yeah, Noona!"
The gray thread stopped shimmering and Jungkook sighed. Catching a vengeful spirit was definitely not part of his plans, today. These creatures could be very difficult to catch. And the more time they spent on the Living Realm, the more sly, vicious ans strong they became.

The Reaper turned back to face the empty space they were in. Hyejin didn’t seem aware of the gravity of the situation. Jungkook approached her.
"We have to go now...", he whispered to her, as gently as possible.
She looked at him like he hung the stars in the sky, smiled, her feline-like eyes disappearing, and got up obediently to follow him. He took the glass from her hands and put it on the small table nearby. He nodded politely at the bartender and walked through the door, Hyejin’s elbow on his hand.
There was complete darkness, on the other side of the door. It took a few seconds before his eyes adapted to the obscurity. The sun never shined in here, the night was eternal and Jungkook knew that. He still couldn't help but shiver a little from the change in temperature. In the Living Realm, he was immune, but not here. He was as much part of this in-between world as the rocks that surrounded them.
There was nothing around them but the last stars evaporating against the empty promise of a sun and a stone path carved by the canyon walls. That emptiness was neither shapeless nor bare and yet, in its immensity, it was frightening. Probably because it was the Domain of Death.
Behind them, the door they had just passed through stood straight and alone, lonely, in the middle of a desert. Jungkook could still see the counter on the other side. When the door closed, Jungkook nudged Hyejin gently to push her towards the mountain that loomed in the distance, right ahead. They had a twenty-ish minutes walk before reaching the Gates of the Arterlife.
They walked in silence, Jungkook lost in his thoughts but his hand anchored in Hyejin’s elbow so she didn’t get lost. He was a bit nervous because soul eating monsters, flesh made of glass and eyes made of embers, desperate with hunger, wandered the desert. They waited for any opportunity, any sign of weakness to jump off and tear unfortunate souls. Jungkook had his weapon ready, just in case, of course.
Luckily, the closer they got to the Gates of the Arterlife, the less chance there was of running into these monsters. And the closer they got, the more people they encountered too: other souls accompanied by other Reapers who all advanced towards the mountain. 
“It’s cold in here,” Hyejin said, after a bit. 
Jungkook looked at her: her gaze was still a bit glassy but she was more present than any other soul he ever accompanied, since the ELEPHANT.
“You’re okay?” he couldn’t help but ask.
“I’m dead, but otherwise, I’m okay, Jeoseungsaja-nim,” she smiled at him.
Jungkook really didn’t understand how it could be possible. She had an Oblivion Drink and the Reaper never heard of it not working on a soul. It was laced with magic Death herself made. But it didn’t really matter, did it? In a few, he was going to drop her right before the Gates and, once she crossed them, she was supposed to get her memories back, anyway.
The mass of people turned then into several waiting lines. Twenty-seven to be exact. They all lead to counters behind which Clerics assigned Defendants to each soul before they walked through the Gates.
When their turn drew near, the Gates of the Arterlife finally appeared in front of them. And they were magnificent.
Oh Hyejin stopped dead in her tracks.
“Wah! This is… They’re huge!”
Jungkook agreed, even if, as a Reaper, Jungkook never got to cross them, of course. Still, that didn’t stop him from being impressed, everytime he came here. Which was at least once a day — be it from escorting souls or after a run, in the outskirts of Maeul, the only city in the In-Between. His eyes were always drawn to the ebony wood, as old as Time, elegantly carved with the stories of the Seven Gods and the Three Fates — or the Three Sisters, as they were sometimes called. 
The World was divided in three. There was the Living Realm, ruled by Shin Soomyeong, the Fate of Life. She was the one who decided all the possible hardships and outcomes of every individual. She was served by Angels who helped her manage her domain.
The In-between was not a physical Realm, strictly speaking. Even if there was this desert where they were right now… But every new departed soul, even if it was still in the Living Realm, belonged to Shin Samang, the Fate of Death, the youngest Sister. She was the one who decided if an outcome ended someone’s life. Reapers served her and helped her collect and guide these souls to Hell. 
It was a necessary work as too much yin energy from the spirits could create unbalance in the world. Everything the Fate of Death did was to prevent any disturbance in the Balance and her Reapers helped her collect and escort spirits. They all lived in Maeul — long called Maeulmoon (Maeul = Village and Moon = Gates). Reapers were humans who made unforgivable mistakes and had to serve the In-Between as a punishment. 
The oldest sister and First Fate, Shin Chulsaeng presided at Birth and didn’t need minions. She was the one who decided where and when a person is born, the family they will — or won’t — have, their personality… Every little thing that made a human what they were, their individuality, their difference, their quintessence, Shin Chulsaeng was the one who decided it. Jungkook never saw her but it was known that she lived in Maeul, making dolls all day.
Everything beyond the Gates was the Domain of King Yeomra. Each one of the Seven Hells — originally ten but there was a big reorganization a few centuries back — had its own Judge that specialized in specific sins. They were served by Demons who helped them assess, examine and defend a soul. And punish it if deemed guilty.
Angels were not inherently good and Demons were not bad, as humans thought. A Demon was a being created from a Flame, and an Angel was a being created from pure Light and nothing more. There were good and bad Angels and good and bad Demons, just like humans — although the Fate of Life was ruthless and didn’t tolerate unlawful Angels. Some Demons even spent their eternity defending souls and helping them get out of Hell, making their journey through the underworld as quick as possible. They were called Defendants.
For example, King Yeomra was the King of the Seven Hells but he was also the Judge of Filial Piety — among other sins. Souls who didn’t respect their parents, ancestors or elders in general were sent to him and they had to defend themselves before him, helped by Defendants. If a Judge thought someone was guilty, their soul could spent centuries being punished in that particular Hell before moving to the next one and be judged again for another sin. By a different Judge.
Before even crossing the Gates, King Yeomra was the one who decided if a Soul was worthy of reincarnation or not. If it was, it could go through the Gates and be assessed and judged. If not, the soul was given a choice: become a Reaper or being eaten by the Imugi, a serpentine monster with a hideous human head. Jungkook shivered every time he remembered the creature and the way it moved, lazily, voluptuously.
Dangerously.
Jungkook thought that whoever was presented with that choice hadn't really had one, in the first place, but he preferred not to think about it. Despite everything he had done, despite the sin he had committed, despite the fact that he agreed with King Yeomra that he did not deserve to be reincarnated… He had cowardly chosen to serve for eternity than to be annihilated, reduced to nothingness. He preferred to think it was because he would rather atone for his sins, but he knew better than anyone that his choice had been driven by his fear. His fear of never seeing the people he wronged again. His fear of not spending eternity apologizing as soon as he could to the reincarnations of the ones he hurt. His fear of giving up this chance to hope and proving right all those who had said he was just a selfish bastard, a monster.
Jungkook surreptitiously shook his head and his thoughts: they had arrived, it was their turn and it was probably not the time to think of such horrendous deeds. 
“Hello,” Hyejin bowed, and the Cleric frowned at her. 
Shrugging, he opened a file on his desk and examined it, before stamping several pages. When he got to the last page, he frowned again.
"Mmmhh… The King has already decided that Oh Hyejin-ssi deserves to be reincarnated. I even see that she will have the benefits of a Paragon."
A Paragon! Jungkook thought. 
It wasn't that rare but it wasn't that common. Paragons were models of virtue or people who had done great things or sacrificed their lives to save others. Throughout his nearly thousand-year-old career as a Reaper, Jungkook could count the number of Paragons he had guided on his ten fingers. He looked at Hyejin, now sitting cross-legged on the ground, observing with curiosity the other lines, ignoring the world around her and he smiled. Hyejin deserved at least that.
"But I see here that a vengeful spirit is tied to her case and I'm afraid we have to wait for it to be taken care of."
"I'll handle it, Cleric Kim!"
It was a beautiful woman with very short electric blue hair and golden eyes who had uttered this sentence. She had appeared behind the barrier and gave a brief smile to Jungkook.
"Jeon."
"Nam."
She was as beautiful as the day that had never shone on her skin, as deadly and dangerous as the lands on which they stood. Jungkook made a monumental effort to tear his eyes away from her slightly shimmering skin and her gaze full of promises of bliss. Promises that Jungkook have had whispered in his ears from her blood-colored mouth. Bliss he tasted under her hands and her sheets.
Byeol was as gorgeous as he remembered her.
Jungkook cleared his throat and tried to focus on the conversation she was having with the Cleric which Jungkook didn't follow at all, too obsessed with his thoughts.
"-it must be! It's against the rules!"
"Article 13, paragraph 6, Cleric Kim. You know as well as me that these rules doesn’t apply for a Paragon."
The Cleric frowned even more. Then he sighed and shrugged in defeat.
"Very well. You can take her then, Defendant Nam."
Jungkook had spent enough time in the In-Between to know what Article 13 Paragraph 6 was:  More commonly known as the Bulletproof Law, it gave a Paragon the right to spend as little time as possible in the Seven Hells. And Demons and Judges had to adapt for that soul. A Paragon didn’t even go through all the hells but only the ones which concerned them. Hyejin would probably still go before the Fifth Judge Yanro in the Hell of Murder and the Seventh Judge Yeomra in the Hell of Filial Piety since she killed her father, even if she didn't do it on purpose. But Jungkook was not worried at all: Byeol was a force of nature and a passionate and fearless Defendant, from what he had been told and what he knew about her. He knew Hyejin was in good hands.
When Cleric Kim stamped on the last paper, the barrier opened. Jungkook helped hyejin up and led her on the other side. The clerk handed him the file which he put away in his inside pocket and he finally turned to Byeol. 
“Hello,” Hyejin bowed again.
“Uhm… Hello?” Byeol bowed in turn but not before eyeing Jungkook suspiciously.
“Yeah, she still has her memories, even if she had an Oblivion Drink,” Jungkook explained, shrugging.
Hyejin only blinked at him, like she didn’t understand what the word “Oblivion” meant. Byeol was astonished, to say the least.
“What? Oh by the Ten Hells, I’ve never seen anything like it!”
She led them further in, not too far from the Gates, while the clerk was already calling another number.
"Are you okay?"
The question might seem innocuous to anyone who heard it but Jungkook knew Byeol well enough to know that she was nervous.
"What do you mean... ?"
"The… uhm, the spirit. Rumor has it that you'll be the one that will take care of it."
"I've known this myself for an hour only, how come everyone already knows?"
She shrugged.
"That’s the In-Between for you! A vengeful spirit is quite rare these days, with all the arrangements made by the Third Fate to make souls forget their lives until they walk through the Gates of the Afterlife. Everyone is very interested in the matter, so..."
Jungkook saw Hyejin frown.
“I see,” Jungkook replied simply. It wasn't the first vengeful spirit he had to deal with. When he was still a rookie, vengeful spirits were commonplace and Reapers spent more time hunting them than escorting souls.
It must have been four hundred years since things had changed. Still, Jungkook was not afraid: he had continued to train hard, every day, in fighting techniques and to keep himself in shape, unlike other reapers. His military past had perhaps conditioned him to always be ready, but now he was happy to be the one who had been assigned to this mission.
"You— I mean... You'll be careful, won't you?"
Jungkook looked up from the ground where his gaze had been fixed and met Byeol’s golden one. He saw everything she dared not say and Jungkook felt heartbroken. He liked Byeol a lot. She was fierce and amazing and definitely deserved better than him. He blamed himself for hurting the demoness. He could only smile as broadly as he could, hoping to hide the sadness and guilt that clung to his heart.
"Of course! I'm Jeon Freaking Jungkook, the best Reaper that ever was! You'll see, it'll be over in no time."
Byeol’s smile didn't reach her eyes.
"Very well! Good luck, anyway! Mmh… Let’s go, Hyejin-ssi."
"Take care, Byeol-ie..."
She flinched at the pet name and Jungkook wanted nothing more than to be swallowed by quicksands or even the Imugi itself. It was a habit, he didn’t do it on purpose but still…
Nam Byeol took Hyejin's hand in hers and dragged the soul lightly towards the crowd gathered a little further. But just before the mass of spirits and demons swallowed them, Hyejin lingered a bit, tugging at Byeol’s hand and turned around, gaze sharp, a sad but determined smile on her lips.
"Don't forget your promise, Jungkook-ssi!"
Jungkook lost them in the crowd before he could answer.

It was late. Even by Namjoon's standards, who had a pretty fucked up sleep schedule. Taehyung could tell with the way the detective was yawning and the way his eyes were losing focus. Namjoon was still consulting his phone at the slightest vibration of the object, though…
Workaholic!, Taehyung thought, slightly worried about his brother.
They were now in Taehyung's living room, sitting on one of the two couches, Yoongi curled up by his side, already sleeping, his small head on his thigh. As gently as possible, Taehyung stroked his dark curls, afraid to wake the child. The other adults were also whispering but no one wanted to move Yoongi and take him to the bed in the guest room yet. He had indeed fallen asleep a few minutes earlier and seemed exhausted.
Ahn Huiyeon just finished making him sign a bunch of documents and telling him all the forms he needed to fill and all the proofs he needed to provide as soon as possible to the National Child Protection Agency. If Taehyung was honest, he was having a really hard time paying attention. He just silently prayed that Huiyeon would be kind enough to leave him a detailed list somewhere among the papers she was now putting away in a folder.
“With that, I'll leave you, Taehyung-ssi... I'll personally come and make sure you're taking good care of Yoongi in the next few days. If you don't send me your files within 3 days, I'll have to place him somewhere else. Do you understand?”
Taehyung sat up straight and nodded, determined.
“To be honest,” she continued, “if he didn’t seem already kind of attached to you, I wouldn’t be doing this.”
Yoongi refused to let go of Taehyung’s arm when he returned to him, after their conversation at the convenience store. The doctor even rode home in Namjoon’s car because of that.
Taehyung didn't have the strength to answer and just nodded.
“Joonie, are you coming with me?” Huiyeon asked and Namjoon flinched. He looked around, a little haggard, before laying eyes on Huiyeon and seemingly remembering where he was.
“Y-yep, I'm coming! Tae? Will it be okay with the little one?“
Taehyung interrupted his yawn and looked at Namjoon who was standing up. Huiyeon was already at the door, putting on her coat and slipping into her shoes.
“Yes, hyung! I'll take the next 3 days to watch over him and also figure out how to arrange my schedule to accommodate him.“
“If you need help, you know I'm here, right?“
“Yes, go now, Hyung! Don't keep your sweetheart waiting!“
“Sweetheart, pff...she really isn't that sweet for a sweetheart! She's driving me crazy! In a good way, though.“
He was smiling, dreamy, dimples and all.
“It's good to see you feeling better, Hyung…“
“Go to sleep, you need it!“
“Okay, Hyung! Be careful, please!“
“Always!“
When the door closed, Taehyung looked down at the small head resting on his thigh and smiled. Yoongi was frowning and his mouth sported a small pout. Taehyung put his hand under the child's head and stood up without disturbing his position too much. He made sure that Yoongi was sleeping soundly and then proceeded to carry Yoongi to the guest room. He opened the closet and took out the softest blankets he had, the ones Jimin had given him and had forbidden him to ever use without him. He wrapped the child up and turned on the little bedside lamp. Then he went to fill a glass of water, put it on the nightstand and finally left the room. He left the door ajar so he can hear Yoongi if he needed anything.
Taehyung went to his home office next, opened his computer, sent an e-mail to his department head asking for the next few days. Fortunately, he burried himself in work the last year and a half and he had a lot of days the HR department urged him to take but never felt the need to take, until now. He then called the funeral home of the hospital and took care of everything regarding Oh Hyejin and Oh Seungok — Yoongi’s grandfather, as Namjoon told him. He didn’t want Yoongi to go though the bodies’ preparations. He was maybe overstepping but he had to be there for his own father’s washing and he had nightmares about that for years. So if he could spare that to Yoongi, he would do it.
He also called a driver to get his car and bring it home because he left it at Yoongi’s family house. Finally, he looked for in-house nannies agencies and sent them emails then posted ads on Albamon and Craigslist.
In his room, he quickly changed and got under the sheets. He didn't forget to answer Jimin’s texts but couldn’t tell him about Yoongi. He thought doing it in person would be better and he was too tired to explain anything at the moment.
It was well past 4 o'clock and he was sleepy. Only, his head swirled with thoughts and doubts. He wondered if what he was doing was right, if he was qualified to take care of a child. He thought back to all those years of rejecting the idea of ​​having one and wondered why he was doing this, and why now. The thoughts grew heavier and heavier and weighed on his chest like a rock. He turned around then, stared at the ceiling and tried to relax all his muscles and breathe more slowly, evenly. He then reminded himself that he had to be more indulgent with himself and that he was aware that a child was a big responsibility. A responsibility that he was ready to assume, that he was ready to arrange his life around for as long as Yoongi needed. The reasons were simple enough: he could do so and he wanted to. Maybe Yoongi was reminding him of his own story. Maybe he needed to feel useful — because, these days, his job wasn't giving him that at all. Whatever the reason, Taehyung was convinced that it was the best decision. For Yoongi and for him. And he didn't need more for the storm in his head to calm down, for him to sink into a dreamless sleep.
At the stroke of half past ten, Taehyung left Yoongi in front of the TV with some tangerines that Jin had brought with him and went to take a shower. He brushed his teeth and dressed soberly in black pants, a black blazer, and a white dress shirt.

They got in the car then and Taehyung drove Yoongi to town where they did some shopping to buy some things the kid would need: moon and stars patterned sheets, kid-size slippers shaped like red heart aliens — that were so cute Taehyung almost bought the same for himself! — and a suit.

The suit was for the funeral of Yoongi's mother and grandfather.

Taehyung drove to the hospital, his place of work and got off at the funeral home. He helped Yoongi get dressed in one of the mourners' locker rooms and pinned a hemp armband to his jacket arm when he was done. He then went to place the photos of Oh Hyejin and Oh Seungok that he had brought back with him on their respective altars.

Usually, funerals started immediately after people died, but given the circumstances, they had only taken place now. Taehyung had booked two rooms, paid for the flowers and the food. Namjoon had explained to him that Oh Hyejin was apparently hit by her father — something Taehyung had deducted by himself, given the fresh injuries and old bruises she had on her. But that also probably explained why Yoongi was afraid to even look at his grandfather's picture.

So Taehyung and Yoongi avoided the old man’s room and were waiting in Oh Hyejin's.

She received no visitors.

Oh Seungok, on the other hand, received a dozen visits, each more unpleasant than the other. They were old friends of the dead man and were quick to voice their displeasure with Hyejin and what an ungrateful child she was. After the third insult to Yoongi's mother, Taehyung decided to take care of hosting those people alone.

At the end of the day, it was clear that no more would come for either. They decided then to leave.

Coming out of the restroom, Taehyung noticed that Oh Hyejin's room was empty and he panicked slightly because he left Yoongi under the supervision of one of the funeral home employees but he was also nowhere to be found. He started looking for Yoongi everywhere without success. It was when he considered seriously calling Namjoon or going to the security post to look at the CCTV footage that he finally saw his small silhouette in front of his grandfather's altar. 

Completely still.

Taehyung stood in the doorway but noticed how cold it was in that room. He barely could stop himself from shaking. Yoongi, however, seemed unaffected by the temperature. He was kneeling in front of the photo, placed well above him and with his back to Taehyung so that the doctor couldn't get the child's expression. Taehyung could still feel the tension in the air and thought about pressing Yoongi to go because the place was giving him goosebumps. But he decided otherwise and preferred to let the little boy handle his pain as he saw fit. All he needed to do was be there, supportive.

It was then that the strangest thing happened. Taehyung felt the air grow heavier than humanly possible. He was only on the doorstep and yet he felt like he was suffocating. He then saw Yoongi slowly get up and approach the frame. When he got to its level, he reached out his hand as if to grab the picture and Taehyung, not really knowing why, only wanted one thing: to shout at Yoongi to get out of there, to not touch the frame. But it's like his voice was stuck in his throat and his feet were pinned to the ground.

Bang!

Several things happened at the same time: The frame’s glass exploded, the temperature returned to normal, the air was no longer heavy and Taehyung regained the use of his legs. And his voice.

“YOONGI!“

He ran towards the little boy and caught him just as his body lurched and fell to the ground, like a puppet whose strings had been cut. Taehyung examined the child but he seemed... like he was only asleep. Nonetheless, the doctor didn't want to take any risks: the little one cramped up his arms, he ran towards the upper floors, towards his domain: the hospital.

Jungkook was pissed. Some can even say angry. That damn vengeful spirit had managed to escape him. 

Again!

There was definitely something strange about this family! First, there was the child who happened to be able to see him when he shouldn't. Next, the mother who had her memories intact hours after her trespassing, thus resisting the Magic of Death itself. Even with an Oblivion Drink, Hyejin still had enough lucidity to remember Jungkook's promise. This was not normal.

And now the grandfather. The vengeful spirit. He was definitely more comfortable with his new powers than any other vengeful spirit created only the day before! He was already able to manipulate his energy, well enough to have effect on the Living Realm. As proof: he had just blocked access to the room where his altar was, probably nourished by the gossip of people who had visited him, comforting him in the rightness of his delirium. He also managed to possess his grandson? Jungkook wasn't sure. He just knew that Yoongi didn't hear him, despite his incessant calls, and was acting weird. The frame glass exploding was nothing compared to the other two phenomena — the energy wall and the possession — but Jungkook still didn't understand.

As soon as the spirit was gone, the Reaper made sure that Yoongi was taken care of. Doctor Kim Taehyung was there, thankfully, though Jungkook was sure he too must have figured out that something unnatural had happened.

Then, Jungkook stepped out of the funeral home to call Lee Hanee.

“Noona!“

“Oh? Kook! Are you still working?“

“Yeah…! I have a vengeful spirit to catch, remember?“

“Of course but you know how they are only active at night, the first few days, I thought you would take a break after accompanying uh... the girl yesterday.“

“Oh Hyejin.“

“Yes, that's it, Oh Hyejin.“

“Well… I guess we have a problem.“

“What do you mean?”

“Oh Seungok just attacked his grandson by blowing up his photo frame at the funeral home! And he created an energy shield powerful enough to ward me in.”

“What? But- Didn’t he die only yesterday?“

The tone of her voice was incredulous and Jungkook fully understood why.

“Noona, I tell you… He created a force field around him, so strong and so focused that I couldn't get past it... Worse, I think he possessed his grandson.“

“Poss- What? It's not- Kook, are you sure about that?“

“Noona...“

He didn't need to say more. The distress in his voice answered for him.

“Okay, okay... Kook! Do you need help? Do you want me to send backup?“

“Maybe later, when I understand what's going on! No need to put more people in danger, for the moment. However, I will need to talk to Lee Chungho... He- Is he okay?“

“He's still knocked out, to be honest. We just thought it was fatigue and being taken by surprise by a vengeful spirit. But now that you're telling me all that, I wonder if there isn't more...?“

“More? Like?“

“I don't know, Kook... I really don't know. I'll keep an eye on him and let you know as soon as I hear anything. In the meantime... Promise me to be careful, okay ?“

“I promise, Noona!“

The call ended and Jugnkook looked around but no trace of the vengeful spirit. It didn't surprise him: after such an unusual manifestation of energy, it was intense enough to drain any spirit. He would need a few weeks to recover. Or a few days, considering how fast everything was for this particular vengeful spirit.

Jungkook flapped his wings and appeared a few floors higher. He searched for long minutes before finding Yoongi. The boy was apparently asleep, an IV attached to his little hand. Doctor Kim Taehyung was sitting by his bedside and was holding his other hand, looking completely devastated. Jungkook felt sorry for him and was tempted, for a second, to make himself visible just to be able to reassure him.

Of course, he didn't.

Nevertheless, Jungkook approached Yoongi and put his hand on the child's forehead. He sighed in relief: no trace of possession. His contentment was only short-lived, however… There was something wrong with his energy, too much yin. The Reaper didn’t know if it was because Yoongi had come across a spirit or if the unbalance was something he was born with. Such disrupt in his energy could explain why he could see Jungkook, for example. 

He raked his brain, trying to figure out how something like this was possible, why it was happening and how it explained — or not — the strange events of the last 24 hours.

Jungkook decided to stay until Yoongi woke up but to stay out of his sight. So he stood up, behind the half-opened curtains, just to make sure that Oh Seungok wasn't lurking around and that Yoongi was okay. Like that, he had plenty of time to observe Doctor Kim Taehyung's sullen and worried expression. From time to time, he passed his hand over his face or caressed the small porcelain hand in his and Jungkook was mesmerized even by these simple gestures. More than he cared to admit, he had to remember to close his mouth and remind himself to stare at something other than the doctor because it was getting a little creepy.

Still, Jungkook's heart fluttered in his chest and something in him soared when he saw Taehyung's beautiful square smile lighting up his face because Yoongi had woke up.

With a sad smile, the Reaper disappeared in a flutter of wings.

The first day was far from perfect.

Taehyung was roused from his slumber early — far too early for his liking. He tried to remember, rolling over under his sheets, why he had set the alarm clock so early when he heard small, short, quick footsteps in the hallway.

Yoongi.

The events of the day before came back to him and he straightened up so quickly it made him dizzy. He deactivated the alarm on his phone, got up and walked towards Yoongi's room. The door was wide open. He stopped at the threshold and knocked three times, smiling at the fact that the boy was hiding under his duvet.

“Hungry?“

Yoongi stuck his nose out from under his blanket and looked at Taehyung suspiciously, not responding.

“I'm pretty bad at cooking but I have some cinnamon rolls in the freezer my brother brought me, are you okay with that?“

Yoongi sat down on his bed with his legs still covered and bowed his head, fumbling with the sheet.

“I'm allergic to cinnamon.“

“Oh?“

That was some new and important information! Taehyung had to be careful.

“Okay, I'm going to cook some rice, in the meantime, you can take a shower! Do you need help?“

He shook his head: “No.”

Taehyung held out his hand and Yoongi finally got up and walked slowly until he caught it. The adult then led him to the bathroom.

“There's shampoo there, shower gel and...“

Taehyung took out new clean towels and put them on the small cabinet adorned with an eucalyptus vase.

“Here are the towels!“

He opened the cabinet drawer and pulled out a brand new neon green toothbrush and put it in the little pot above the sink, beside Jimin’s bright pink one. He grabbed the toothpaste that was already there and read the ingredients to be sure it didn't contain cinnamon as that spice was in a lot more things than we thought. Fortunately, this one didn’t.

“Thank you, Ahjussi.“

Taehyung ruffled Yoongi's hair.

“Don't lock the door, I won't come in without asking you first. If you need anything, you call me, okay?“

Yoongi nodded and Taehyung headed to his room to retrieve his phone. Two rings later, a cheerful voice answered.

“So you do remember you have a brother, wah! Taehyung-ssi! I'm proud of you!“

“Good morning to you too, Hyung! How are you?“

“Glad to know I'm still a part of our maknae’s life...“

Taehyung smiled, repressing a laugh.

“Cut the drama, Jin-Hyung! I'm calling you for an emergency!“

“Huh! And here I was thinking... Aigoooo! Anyway, I'll take the crumbs you give me, it's okay! How can I help you, today, Taehyung-ssi?“

“I euhm- ah yes! I didn't tell you but… I'm welcoming a little boy into my home for a while.“

“Excuse me? Did I hear you right?“

“Yeah, he lost his family and I’m taking care of him until they find his relatives and... It’s only temporary, though. Anyway, you know how bad I am at cooking! I wanted to warm him up the cinnamon rolls you left me last time but he's allergic to the spice so— Hyung?“

Taehyung heard noises from the other side of the line.

“I'll be at your house in ten minutes!“

Taehyung could hear he was on speakerphone now.

“No, fifteen, I'm out of carrots, I made a carrot cake yesterday... It was super tasty and I'd bring you some but there's cinnamon in it and— Hoseok-ssi, can you help me— yes, and get the car ready, I have to be at Taehyung's as soon as possible... Tae-bear, I expect all the details when I see you!“

Without further ceremony and without surprise, he hung up.

When Jin arrived, Yoongi had finished his shower and Taehyung his first latte. The boy had put on the same clothes as the day before and put on his mom's hoodie over it. Taehyung smiled sadly, helped him roll his sleeves and messaged Namjoon to make arrangements and bring some of Yoongi’s things there. Yoongi was sitting in the high chair now and watching Jin maneuver his wheelchair between the kitchen island and the stove.

“So, what's your name?“ Jin asked, slicing his spring onions in one fluid motion.

“Huh? Oh! Yoongi! My name is Min Yoongi! Ahjussi, waaah! That's so cool! How do you do it?“

Jin smiled and assumed very fake superior airs.

“Years of practice! Unfortunately, you're too young to handle a knife, but if you want, you can crack the eggs and beat them for the omelet! Here, I'll show you how…“

Jin rinsed the eggs and prepared a small bowl and a big one. He cracked an egg in the small one and then slipped it into the larger one.

“That's also why you have to wash the eggs! That way, if any shells fall off, you can easily remove them and still use the egg!“

Yoongi looked euphoric. Using a fork, he was beating the eggs while Jin explained to him what he was doing and Taehyung was content to sip his second latte, watching over them. From time to time, Jin asked him to do things, like getting the salt or rinsing some vegetables. And he did.

The breakfast was very good: the japchae was delicious, the cheese kimchi mushroom omelette too. Yoongi ate heartily and Taehyung’s heart fluttered at that: Yoongi was way too skinny. Namjoon joined them in the middle of the meal and dropped several bags at the entrance which Taehyung guessed were Yoongi's clothes and textbooks. The policeman quickly ate with them and Taehyung felt a strange warmth invade him. It had been a long time since he had had his two brothers to eat with. Usually, every Sunday, they had lunch at their parents' in the outskirts of Seoul. It was their little family tradition. But it had been 6 months since their mother left for Costa Rica to finalize an acquisition the family company had made. Their father had of course accompanied her, unable to live without the love of his life for more than a few days, per his own words.

“And it seems that Costa Rica has some great landscapes, I'm sure I can find something to paint there!“, he confided in Taehyung with a little wink.

Taehyung adored his family. He and Namjoon had been adopted by Kim Byunghun and Kwon Sunhee. He was a gifted painter although not that famous, given his talent, and she was the CEO of a successful cosmetic company she built from the ground up. 

Jin was their biological child. That said, never had Taehyung felt he was less loved than his brothers and their parents had done an amazing job raising them.

Jin was a chef and had his own chain of coffee shops all over South Korea — “And soon an opening in Kyoto!“ that he was preparing for. He also had a non profit support association for people with disabilities. Suffice to say that he was a very busy man doing a lot of good around him and Taehyung was more than proud to say that Kim Seokjin was his brother. The same was true for Namjoon. At first, his parents did not understand his vocation and his desire to embark on a “difficult and often thankless career”, as his father once said. But they had supported him anyway. And, unsurprisingly, Namjoon had been one of the youngest cops ever to be made Inspector and had solved a few cases that made him heavily decorated and even earned him some TV appearances — much to their mother's pride.

Taehyung was the only one who didn't thrive so much in his job. After Jin's accident, he spent so much time in the hospital and felt so helpless and useless that he decided to become a doctor. He had always been good at school, which made that path easier to pursue for him. He had worked then in one of the most prestigious hospitals of Seoul and was preparing a specialization in thoracic surgery or neurosurgery — he had not yet decided. But the debacle his last breakup was, two years ago… That had put a stop to his career projects. He had therefore accepted the position of an emergency doctor in a small public hospital in Seoul where the means and equipments were far from satisfactory and made his daily work very difficult. 

He loved his job, again and again. But the losses of his patients over the past few months had weighed more heavily on him than he had thought. He did his best to always give the best chance of survival — and life, after surgery — to his patients. But it didn't always go as planned.

And Taehyung was starting to get discouraged.

Having his two brothers around the table had done him good. He had forgotten how precious those moments and his family were to him. Yoongi seemed to blend in as if he had always been their little brother, participating in the conversation with well-constructed sentences and a vocabulary far too advanced for his age that pulled a few high eyebrows from the three brothers.

After his brothers left, it was barely nine o'clock and Taehyung helped Yoongi sort out the things in the bags Namjoon had brought. The detective had even slipped a photo among the textbooks and Taehyung grabbed it before Yoongi saw it. He came out of the room, fetched an old unused frame from the drawer of his desk and put inside the photo of baby Yoongi, his mom and an old lady who didn't look like either of them. Her skin was as fair as Yoongi’s though.

When he returned to the guest room, now Yoongi's room, he put the picture on the bedside table. Yoongi seemed to hold himself back from crying when he saw it and Taehyung gave him the opportunity to admire it quietly while he finished folding the socks and hanging the jeans of the child.

There were also two other photos that Taehyung slipped into his own bag, for later.

Taehyung had warned Huiyeon that Yoongi would not be returning to school for the rest of the week so that he could adjust and Taehyung could accommodate him as best as he could. 

On their second day, a thursday, they spent a great part of the night in the hospital. Yoongi was fine, fortunately, but Taehyung insisted on keeping him on close watch. He still couldn't explain what had happened in the funeral home but he had examined Yoongi and the boy seemed healthy. So Taehyung blamed the little boy's fainting on fatigue and too much emotion.

On their return from the hospital, around midnight, they found a large insulated bag in front of their door. Taehyung smiled because he knew it was Jin who had meals and various banchans delivered to them by his assistant, Hoseok. Taehyung put everything in the fridge and then immediately tucked Yoongi to bed. Just before going to sleep himself, he finally noticed the dozen texts from Jimin and felt guilty for ignoring his best friend for a good part of the day. He wrote back to him, sincerely apologizing, informed him that he had a good reason for not answering his texts and invited him to eat at home in the evening.

Taehyung fell asleep, his phone in his hand.

They spent the next day in the library. 

The funeral was still going on — as it lasted three days — but Taehyung decided not to go back, leaving an officiant to take care of it. He would collect the urns on Saturday and go and place them with Yoongi in a Memorial.

Yoongi seemed weirdly detached when Taehyung explained to him that he won’t be going to school until the next week because they both needed time to adjust to each other and to rest after the emotions of the day before. But when the doctor asked him what he would rather do, Yoongi enthusiastically said he wanted to go to the library. 

He spent the day reading about space, particularly Saturn’s rings and rocket propellants for some reason, while Taehyung took the opportunity to catch up on some of his own readings on drug studies and new techniques in thoracic surgery. At the end of the day, Yoongi was especially pleased when Taehyung offered him his own library card and allowed him to take home some of the books he wanted to continue reading.

They went back home and ordered food — bulgogi for Taehyung and half and half fried chicken for Jimin and Yoongi.

The moment he opened the door, Jimin threw himself into his arms in a tight embrace. And Taehyung returned it: they were used to not seeing each other that often, especially when Jimin was abroad for his dance shows but they talked on the phone at least once a day, and he had sincerely missed his best friend.

“You punk! I thought you ghosted me or that I did something wrong!“

“Ah sorry, Chimmy, I was just...uh...“

“Ahjussi! Can we eat now- oh?“

Yoongi stopped dead and he and Jimin stared at each other for a few seconds before Yoongi grabbed Taehyung's hand and hid behind his thigh, blushing furiously. Surprising, considering how comfortable he had been with Jin and Joon.

Jimin gasped.

“Kim Taehyung! Did you had a f- a child behind my back?“ Jimin whispered, amused.

Taehyung chuckled and stroked Yoongi's head gently before kneeling down in front of him.

“Yoongi, this is my best friend, Park Jimin.“

Yoongi took a quick look at Jimin before throwing himself around Taehyung's neck, cheeks even more rosy. Jimin smiled and shook the plastic bags he had in his hand.

“I understand why you asked me to bring orange juice now!“

Taehyung took Yoongi in his arms and got up with difficulty — he would have to go back to the gym, at this rate — then headed for the living room, Jimin on his heels. He and Yoongi had already arranged the boxes of chicken and bulgogi on the coffee table. Jimin went to the kitchen and returned with a glass which he filled with juice and handed to Yoongi. 

The dinner went unsurprisingly well. The child did not take his eyes off the dancer, mesmerized. Every time Jimin opened his mouth or put a piece of beef — stolen from Taehyung's box — on his plate, Yoongi would fiercely blush or suddenly start stuttering little thanks. It was very much different from his usual well-mannered and confident self but also adorable to see Yoongi basking in the attention. 

Soon, it was time for Jimin to go back home. He had an audition pretty early in the morning and he needed to rest.

After dinner, Yoongi helped Taehyung take the dishes to the kitchen. The sink was really dirty so Taehyung decided to put them in the dishwasher. He heard Yoongi chaging channels and when he came back, the kid was sitting barely centimeters from the TV, watching a basketball game with something akin to awe on his face. 

“Little one!”

He startled a little.

“Ahjussi!“

“You're too close to the screen, I'm sure you'll enjoy the match better from the couch!“

Yoongi looked at him then stood up and walked to the couch. He grabbed the remote and handed it to Taehyung.

“Sorry, here's the remote, you can change it back!“

Taehyung frowned.

“It's okay, we can watch the game until it's your bedtime!“

Yoongi's eyes widened and a rare gummy smile stretched his lips. He climbed the couch and sat cross-legged, staring at the screen. Taehyung peeled some tangerines and put them on a bowl, on the coffee table. He then sat next to Yoongi and then handed him one. Yoongi took it immediately, thanked him in a whisper and started eating.

“You like basketball?“

Yoongi nodded sharply.

“Harabeoji sometimes slept with the sports channel on so I could watch some games but he'd change the program every time he woke up so I've never watched a game from start to finish.“

He recounted all of this like it wasn't something bothering him, like he was describing the weather.

“And do you play?“

“No, eomma said next year maybe because it's expensive.“

He was still eating his tangerine wedges.

“Would you like to play basketball?“

Yoongi's eyes finally left the TV to land on Taehyung, the surprise clearly depicted in them. Then he returned to his match, his rosy cheeks clearly contrasting with the rest of his porcelain complexion.

“I don't know how to play…“

Taehyung smiled and took out his phone.

Jungkook was probably sick. Not physically, not really. But he was feeling endlessly tired these days, had no appetite and no will to get out of bed. Even his brushes and pencils and colors weren’t as inviting as usual. The only thing that kept him going was the need to catch the vengeful spirit.

His sleep schedule was definitely fucked and maybe it was because a very smart little boy and a man with sun-kissed smile and a heart as big as the universe were no strangers to his dreams anymore.

Which made him happy and uneasy at the same time. Happy that his nightmares had subsided after tormenting him for centuries. And uneasy because when he woke up he felt strangely… empty. There was a longing in his heart and he didn’t know what for nor why.

At least, the little boy seemed to be doing okay, not really better and not really worse than the first time Jungkook met him. The Reaper did everything he could to not be seen by him and, so far, he think he did a good job at that. He even saw the kid smile happily at Doctor Kim Taehyung or his friends — when they played games or when the gorgeous adult helped him with his homework.

Not that he was stalking them, he just had to be in their vicinity a lot these days. 

To protect them. 

Definitely not because Jungkook was worried.

The doctor’s appartment got messier — the books borrowed from the library scattered on the coffee table, the usually forgotten game station’s cables lying on the floor like little colorful sleeping snakes, the never ending loads of laundry and the pans and dishes waiting to be washed or put in the dishwasher.

Although, Jungkook was pretty sure that some pans were too burnt for them to be salvaged.

Doctor Kim was kind and tried his best to help Yoongi, that was obvious. It had been less than a week but even that woman from the social services seemed to trust Kim Taehyung with Yoongi and assured him so when she visited.

So why did Jungkook feel so bad?

At first he thought that a terrible vengeful spirit targetting a kid made him angry and worried. Then he thought that he was just intrigued by the peculiar case of Min Yoongi. But that’s not all that was to it, now Jungkook could clearly see it. Feel it. He still was worried, of course, and he was relieved to see the boy in such good hands. But, somehow, he wanted... more. He wanted not to hide from Yoongi. He wanted to push Taehyung out of the kitchen and finally make them some hearthy kimchi jiggae — Yoongi’s favourite — and bask in the way they’d slurp it all until the last drop and smile and-

And what?

Jungkook sighed and rolled out of bed. It was weird. He was weird. He was a Reaper, not a guardian Angel! The wherabouts of Yoongi and Doctor Kim Taehyung shouldn’t concern him. He had a job he loved, some friends — okay, one friend that also happened to be his boss — and hobbies. He was perfectly content with his life.

So, again, why did jungkook feel so bad?

He brushed his teeth looking at the City lights laid before his eyes. Maeul never saw the sun but it didn’t need it to shine: century old trees with eternal shimmering leaves lighted up the streets between the illuminated terracotta houses and even if his house wasn’t on the main place of the city — the Place of the Dead — he could still hear the purring of the forever ongoing effervescence that was happening there.

He took the time to dress and consult the schedule on his notebook. He had seven souls to take care of before the end of the day, and he suspected Hanee to cut him some slack because he had to keep an eye on the vengeful spirit by night. If he could, he’d only focus on that rather than handle it like a background task but he had to do what he had to do.

  Maybe he could drop by Kim Taehyun’s house before the beginning of his shift and ensure that Yoongi was doing good? 

He wondered what the pair was doing, at that moment. It was Sunday afternoon so maybe they were playing games. Jungkook was good at games too and could probably-

This is ridiculous!

Jungkook had to distance himself from Yoongi and Taehyung. His weird obsession was definitely not healthy and it’s not like he could be part of their- no, the kid’s life. He had to severe the still-blooming bond he felt with Yoongi. 

Jungkook knew that it wouldn’t be easy, and that’s why checking up on him by day wasn’t a good idea. He’ll go there late at night, like usual, when he didn’t had to observe and coo at how the doctor and the kid built a little home for themselves...

I’m a fucking creep…

Yeah, it was creepy already that he had to stay invisible and make his existence unknown. It was creepy already how he — accidentally, really! — stumbled on Doctor Kim Taehyung in gray sweatpants and very large shirts twice already. Shirts that fell on his shoulder and gave a glimpse of-

Jungkook shook his head. He didn’t feel good about the situation and felt guilty for intruding. Centuries back, fighting spirits was pretty common and they didn’t have to hide so this was somewhat new to him. And the fact that Yoongi could see him and that the vengeful spirit was, for some reason, a lot more powerful than expected complicated things. 

He have a pretty tattoo, though...

The tought crept its way through Jungkook’s mind before he could stop it and heat invaded his cheeks and ears — which he caught out of habit. He shook his head again then proceeded to head to the entrance and put his shoes, concentrating on his shoelaces in hopes of distracting his thoughts from visiting some doctor who hadn't asked for anything...





Little whimpers. 

That’s what Taehyung thought he heard. His sleep was very light for the last year and a half but sometimes, in his half-sleep haze, he sometimes saw or heard things that did not exist. But he was awake… Perfectly awake. He put the book he was reading aside on his too large bed and looked at the digital clock on his bedside: it was midnight.

He had put Yoongi to bed and tucked him in just two hours before. He pulled up his covers, got up and hurriedly walked towards the little boy's room.

The first thing he noticed was that the light was off. He was sure he had left the bedside table lamp on, at Yoongi's request. But the child might have woken up to turn it off. Or maybe the bulb was broken...

What was even more weird, however, was not the light. It was the oddly cold room temperature. Taehyung had a flashback to the night before, in the Funeral Home and frowned. At least this time the air wasn't abnormally heavy and he was able to move as he wanted in the room. He would call the building superintendent first thing tomorrow to check the heating and he would add some blankets for Yoongi after he calmed him down.

Yoongi didn't seem to be cold at all, though, even though he was bathed in sweat and making little noises from time to time.

Taehyung approached, not sure of what to do. Then he remembered how his adoptive mother used to hug him when he had nightmares of his own when he was little. It seemed to calm him every time, to have her reassuring presence with him, to have her arms around him, to have an anchor in the real world, far from the monsters and the painful memories that populated his dreams.

Taehyung sat down on the bed, looking worried. He checked Yoongi's temperature by putting his hand on his forehead but it seemed normal. Gently, then, he took Yoongi in his arms, from beneath the covers, and hugged him tightly but careful all the same. With a hand, he put the soaked locks from his forehead.

“It'll be fine, little one, wake up, it's just a nightmare...“

But Yoongi didn't wake up. He seemed inert and only the little sounds he made from time to time indicated that he was not unconscious but simply sleeping. Taehyung frowned and stroked Yoongi's hair, rocking back and forth as he whispered that everything would be fine.

Taehyung's heart pounded furiously as the window swung open suddenly, allowing the icy air to envelop them even more. Taehyung tried to reason with himself that it was just the wind, just the wind that somehow opened the damn thing. He took the covers and pulled them over Yoongi and him, ignoring the movements of the window. But just as his nerves were finally starting to calm down, the closet doors opened and also started banging violently. Taehyung again felt like the air was getting heavier. He tried to get up, Yoongi in his arms, to take refuge elsewhere but it was as if his legs had suddenly turned into cotton wool.

The lamp exploded.

He let out a real cry then and his legs seemed to have regained mobility and a brain of their own because when he opened his eyes again, he was in his bedroom, between his bed and the far wall, Yoongi's blanket wrapped around them, like the last bastion of safety it was.

“Ahjussi.“

Taehyung startled and looked down at Yoongi.

“Yoongi! Are you okay?“

“Ahjussi...“

The child nuzzled Taehyung's neck and started crying.




What happened the night before made Jungkook extremely angry, the kind of anger that he could only wear off at the arena — where he spent the whole day and maybe explained some of his exhaustion. But it was necessay because that spirit… was something else. It was strong but also vicious and adapted way too quickly to anything thrown at him. Jungkook had yet to find what made it tick and it frustrated him deeply.

As soon as he finished escorting his quota of souls, the day before, he had flown to Doctor Kim Taehyung's and what he found made his blood run cold: the child was in some kind of haze, cradled in the doctor’s arms and the spirit was trying to gather energy to attack them, perched in a corner. 

Jungkook unfurled his chain whip in a churning rattle.

The window and one of the closet doors were swinging furiously along with the wind and the energy the spirit was trying to deploy. And the doctor seemed eerily calm as if on the prowl, all his senses on alert. Or maybe he was too scared to act. Whatever it really was, Jungkook needed him and the kid out of the way, out of the bedroom. Out of the apartment, even.

Because if anything happened to any of the two humans, Jungkook wasn’t sure he could handle it.

The lamp exploded.

That’s when things seemed to speed up: the doctor stood up, Yoongi inert in his arms and ran out of the room and the spirit tried to follow them.

In a stealthy motion of the wrist, Jungkook wrapped his chain around the spirit's waist and pulled and the creature finally seemed to notice the Reaper. In a fit of fury, she charged him and they landed against the desk. Jungkook passed through the wall unscathed but he heard loud thuds coming from the other side. When he got up and entered the room from the wall again, the child's books were on the floor and the creature was bellowing loudly. Jungkook couldn't see its face as it kept changing, as if its features wanted to settle but waited for ripples to stop. Still, his mouth was way too big for his face, adorned with multitple sets of sharp teeth and looked more like a flattened snout than anything else.

The spirit charged again, fist way too far forward. Jungkook took a step to the side and with his chain, whipped hard the hand that was where his head was a few seconds earlier. Without giving the creature time to react or retaliate, he struck directly just above the collarbone. This caused the creature to capsize and it fell to the ground, not far from the bed.

It got up quickly enough and they stared at each other for a few seconds. The bed began to shake then, the closet door slammed even more violently and the glass debris of the lamp began to flutter around the spirit.

With a hiss, they headed, sharp and deadly towards Jungkook.

He dodged but not fast enough, one of them scratched his face, another his left arm and one lodged in his right thigh.

Jungkook refrained from screaming.

Frowning, trying as best he could to ignore the pain, he moved toward the creature, determined. It rolled on the bed and landed on the other side but Jungkook did not stop moving forward. The bed then slid as if on wheels to stop him but as soon as the object stopped moving, Jungkook was able to cross it as if it didn't exist.

Anything that was charged with the yin energy of the spirit could reach the Reaper. Anything that wasn’t, he could move through. And moving a bed was energy-intensive and unsustainable so the creature abandoned and prepared to defend. Jungkook could see it from the way it observed him. The Reaper clicked his chain again and it lit up, incandescent: he fed the weapon with his own energy. He hit once, twice, three times, and unexpectedly the spirit dodged the blows each time and the chain hit the headboard. Jungkook was sure it would leave marks but it was the least of his problems, at this point.

Jungkook held his chain tighter in his fist and slid it into his other closed palm. He got as close as he could and kicked the monster in the thorax. The spirit then plunged and grabbed Jungkook by the chest who, under the weight, flinched and took a few steps back. The Reaper opened his legs to improve his stance, grabbed the chain again and slipped it into his left hand behind the spirit's back. He looped it then on its neck from the front and choked as hard as he could. Seeing that it affected the spirit but it'd take too long for it to surrender just like this, he pushed with all his weight on the creature's chin until it was on the ground.

Then something weird happened again: the creature just... combusted on the spot and evaporated without any trace.

Jungkook didn’t understand. Did the spirit die? He doubted the blows he had suffered were not fatal. But spirits could not teleport and definitely not by blazing like that.

He immediately called Hanee and relaid everything that happened. She seemed puzzled and didn’t speak until he finished his story.

“Okay, I’m not sure but I think I’ve heard something about spirits combusting like that, I’ll do some research and maybe ask Sunbae about it. In the meantime, this is far too dangerous, Kook, I think you should stop this solo mission for now.”

“What? Noona! That thing seems relentless and won’t stop until it has what it wants and a child’s life is at stake! I can’t do this right now!”

“Kook, we don’t know what we’re dealing with! And you need medical attention so just head to the Seocho Lighthouse, I’ll meet you there and we’ll get you patched up and-“

“It’s okay, Noona, you don’t have to come, I-“

“Nonsense! We’ll talk when I’ll get there.”

Hanee was one stubborn woman and Jungkook wasn’t really the accommodating type but he loved Hanee and would die for her if she asked. So he just sighed and looked at the mess in that room. Nothing could explain logically what had happened there and he was sure Doctor Kim Taehyung would probably freak out when he would come to the room again. Jungkook seriously considered cleaning things up but he had to head to the Lighthouse quickly because, as a Reaper, his wounds closed up very fast and he still had glass in his tigh. He also fought the urge to and go and check on Kim Taehyung and Yoongi. It wasn’t fair, what was happening to them and he only hoped that the doctor wouldn’t be too spooked to give up on fostering Yoongi because of this mess. The child deserved to be taken care of properly and, if he was honest, Jungkook thought that in a typical foster home or an orphanage with more people, the spirit could do a lot more damage.

He looked at the window, now completely motionless and felt the wind on his face. 

They’ll get cold.

And, without thinking twice, Jungkook made himself visible and closed the window.

Overprotective noona

At the Lighthouse, things didn’t go very well.

Reapers couldn’t die and they healed quickly but they could still feel pain and no anesthetics worked on them. And removing glass shards from a thigh was apparently very painful. The Healer at the Lighthouse was concentrating on picking the last little fragments when Hanee barged in there, looking beautiful as always, with cascading black hair and deadly red lipstick. She ignored the Healer and Jungkook’s hiss of pain and hugged him tight.

“Kook! Didn’t I tell you not to get hurt?”

The Healer cleared his throat but she didn't spare him a look and cupped Jungkook's face in her hands, cupping his cheeks, looking deeply in his eyes.

“Are you okay?”

“Noona! I’m in the middle of something, here…?”, he said, his voice muffled and pouty and his speech slightly deformed because she was still squeezing his face.

After a beat, she let got and nodded politely towards the Healer who snickered and resumed his work.

When he finally finished cleaning and bandaging the wounds and left the room — all the while Hanee, her arms crossed on her chest, kept tapping with her foot impatiently and annoyingly — she hugged Jungkook again.

“I’m so happy you’re okay!”

Jungkook hugged her back too and buried his nose in her neck.

“I’m taking you off the case, for now”, she said, breaking the embrace.

“Noona! No, we already talked about this and that boy is in danger!”, Jungkook shouted, taken aback.

“But we don’t know what we’re dealing with! I need time to figure it out! I’m not even sure an exorcism will be enough to get rid of this thing! So, until further notice, you’re to stay out of this!”

“But Noon-“

“No, Jeon Jungkook! This is an order!”

Jungkook closed his mouth immediately. It was rare for Hanee to assume her role as leader with him or to take this tone and the Reaper respected her far too much to contradict or disobey her.

“Okay, I won’t hunt that thing”, he said finally.

“There’s a but coming, isn’t it?”

Hanee knew him very well indeed.

“Let me keep an eye on them, please?”

She looked at him, stony-faced, her emotions schooled. Only her eyebrows, knotted in a frown, indicated the storm that must have been going on inside her head.

“Noonaaaa! Hells, the boy is seven! And doesn’t a death not caused by life something we must prevent?”

Jungkook knew he won the moment a snicker appeared on her lips.

“You little rascal! Since when you care about the Fairness Law? Okay then! You can keep an eye on them, if you insist this much but from afar, understood?”

Jungkook didn’t tell her about Yoongi being able to see him. He didn’t know if he only could see Jungkook or if he could see other Reapers too. But he already intended to stay away as much as possible.

“Yes, Noona! You can count on me!”

Elementary, my dear Ahjussi

A ghost
A ghost.

Taehyung didn’t believe in these things at all, of course. But considering the events of the night before and the state of Yoongi’s room that morning, Taehyung had to admit that the child’s explanation might hold some truth.

Maybe.

It was monday morning and Yoongi was already dressed and sitting on the high stool, eating his breakfast. He wasn’t touching his weirdly crunchy eggs, though. With his piercing and feline eyes, the boys seemed to be sizing him up. Taehyung nearly swallowed his latte the wrong way.

“I'm not lying...“, Yoongi whispered, finally lowering his head.

“I didn't say you were lying!“ Taehyung rushed to defend himself.

“But you don't believe me...“

Taehyung put his mug on the counter and leaned on it to ruffle Yoongi’s hair.

“It's not that and you know it... I don't understand what happened, that's all.“

“But I told you, I saw everything! And I just explained it to you!“, Yoongi said, with some uncharacteristic impatience.

And yes, Yoongi had just explained to him by telling him one of the most bizarre stories Taehyung had ever heard. Yoongi was apparently aware of everything going on around him when Taehyung thought he was unconscious, even before Taehyung entered his room. He claimed that a dark figure in the corner of his room woke him up with its incessant groans and whispering. He tried to call for Taehyung or get up to hide in the adult’s room but apparently couldn't move. He felt like something was pressing on his chest, making it hard for him to breathe. Then, shortly after Taehyung hugged him, a man dressed in all black appeared from thin air and started attacking the figure.

Taehyung had drawn only one conclusion from all of this: that Yoongi was probably suffering from sleep paralysis.

Oh! And that he had a wild imagination.

“If you don’t believe me, how do you explain the state of the room, then?“

They both had slept in Taehyung’s room. In the morning, the doctor had mustered all his courage before opening the boy’s room door, constantly repeating to himself that it was only a nightmare, the result of his imagination or even simply the wind. But what he had found had proven him wrong and stopped him on the threshold. The bed looked like it had been pulled out and sat in the middle of the room rather than against the wall and there were some marks on the headboard. Yoongi's books as well as his clothes were mostly on the floor. One of the closet doors was definitely broken.

That said, the weirdest thing was the window: it was closed.

No matter how much Taehyung racked his brains, he didn't understand.

“I believe you“, he said to Yoongi, defeated and was surprised to realise that he wasn't lying at all.

He had always been afraid of monsters and his nightmares had been filled with them at night when he was a child. But these monsters were very much human, and had always been. So Taehyung never needed to believe in a higher evil because he knew it existed in all of us, already.

Yoongi pulled him out of his thoughts.

“And now?“

“What now?“

Yoongi rolled his eyes and Taehyung suppressed a coo.

“The ghost is likely to return!“

“I thought the other man fought him... So maybe he killed the ghost?“, he theorized, hopeful.

Yoongi only frowned.

“A ghost is already dead, by definition, Ahjussi! It cannot be killed.“

Taehyung opened his mouth to retort but found nothing to say. So he closed it then, not without a pout.




The events of that evening did not happen again or, at least, not on the same scale. Yoongi slept with him for the next two nights and he continued to have a lot of nightmares. Several times a night, Taehyung hugged him and reassured him as best he could. He had got the habit of preparing him a cup of warm milk with a little bit of honey to help him go back to sleep if Yoongi couldn't calm down. And it helped.

Taehyung still noticed other odd little things. For example, Yoongi was very clumsy. At least, that's what Taehyung's rational brain was trying to make him believe. Around the child, things just… fell, cracked or even exploded. This is how Taehyung had lost a mug, three glasses, a plate, a shower head and a bathroom mirror. Fortunately, none of these accidents had ended in injury so Taehyung was relieved. 

He hadn't dared to talk about all of this to anyone. Well, first, because he thought no one was going to believe him. But the main reason was mostly because he wasn't sure he knew how to explain it all. Jimin had felt that Taehyung was distressed when they talked over the phone but hadn't pushed further when the younger had replied that it was only because Yoongi was having nightmares and that they were having a little trouble finding their bearings.

Which wasn't quite true.

Of course, adjusting to each other was not the easiest thing to do but Yoongi was a fairly reasonable child, a little too much even. Taehyung sometimes wished Yoongi forgot to be a small adult and acted like a child. But he enjoyed their small talk, the way his eyes lit up whenever he talked about what he was passionate about — and Yoongi had a lot of passions. Like... a lot: space and science, of course, but also basketball, the piano, animals, photography and an astonishing — but very much new — penchant for the occult.

They still spent most of their afternoons at the library, at Yoongi’s request, since school ended at three. He did his homework there then would read until it was time to go home. Except that instead of the usual books on Saturn or rockets, Yoongi now would pick books on ghosts, spirits and shamanism. Taehyung of course didn't object and even read over the boy's shoulder some interesting passages on how to banish a ghost from your home. He hadn't finished reading but it involved chicken blood so he took the book from Yoongi's hands and asked him to read something else. Yoongi didn't protest, he just sulked and complied.

Taehyung was just happy to have took these few days off and to have asked that his schedule was moved for a few days. It was a good idea he had there.

***

Yoongi had returned to school and it was already a week since Taehyung opened his home and heart to the little boy. Jimin went to get Yoongi from school and babysat for him once when the doctor had an emergency operation that took longer that initially planned. But it was okay, Jimin assured him and Taehyung had a bunch of potential nannies to interview that weekend, anyway.

On Thursday, he spent the evening changing the bathroom mirror while Yoongi did his homework at home, for once. They ate slowly, to the sound of a documentary on black holes, Taehyung having a hard time bringing Yoongi's attention to his plate but not wanting to turn off the TV because the kid seemed really interested. Usually they ate in the kitchen but after trying to cook pasta — Jin's meals had already been all gobbled up — and nearly setting the building on fire, they decided to order and eat in front of the TV.

On Friday, after their quick visit to the library to return some books, he tidied up with a little of Yoongi’s help. And when Taehyung came back from taking out the trash bags, he found the boy on the sofa, busy reading a book — thankfully littered with photos of nebulaes and some complicated diagrams and no ghosts. It was far too heavy for his small arms and so he had wedged it against his crossed legs. He was absorbed in it and didn’t look up when Taehyung entered.

“Why aren't you dressed yet?”

Yoongi looked up at him briefly then set his book aside.

“Are we eating out?”

“No, we're going to the park. Put on your shorts and sneakers too…”

“The park? But isn’t it late?”, Yoongi protested.

“It’s only five and I have a surprise for you but if you don’t want it, it’s okay!”

Yoongi's eyes were full of questions but he just nodded and went to his room.

***

“Hi, Isak!“

“Hi, Tae! It's been a while! Is this the famous Min Yoongi?“

Yoongi's left hand was in TaeHyung's and he was trying to hide behind the adult's thighs, but still casting some appreciative glances at Hong Isak. Taehyung totally understood the boy: Isak was tall, well over 2 meters, his smile was as bright as the sun and he was doing tricks with a basketball.

 “Yes! Thank you for agreeing to take him last minute! If he likes it, we'll consider subscribing to more lessons…“
How Taehyung doesn’t want to think about the possibility of Yoongi being yaken away in a few days.
Yoongi poked his head out from behind Taehyung and stared at him with wide eyes.

“I'm gonna… I'm gonna learn basketball?“

His voice was small and hesitant.

“If you want to, of course! Isak here is a friend of mine from the hospital and he teaches basketball here twice a week so yeah…“

Yoongi squeezed Taehyung's hand in gratitude but his face was riveted to the ground. Isak extended an inviting hand to the little boy.

“Hi! I'm Isak, the ones before us there just finished playing so let's go, Yoongi-ssi.“

Yoongi smiled shyly but still took his hand and followed Isak to the small group of kids gathered in the corner. When he was halfway there, he stopped though, turned back and let go of Isak’s hand who in turn looked worried and followed him with his eyes. Yoongi sprinted and didn’t stop until he was in front of Taehyung.

“What is it, little one?”

“Ahjussi! Will you stay until we finish playing?“

“Yes, I’m not going anywhere! I'll be behind the fence all the time. How about uh… Ice cream afterwards?“

Yoongi's gummy smile appeared again and made his eyes disappear. He nodded then ran back to the group.

Taehyung got out of the fenced grounds and went to the side where some parents were gathered. He didn't feel like joining them so he went a little farther but still where he could watch Yoongi. There was a bench under a tree, he sat down and watched the little boy talking animatedly to one girl with a high ponytail and the littlest black Red Bulls basketball shirt he ever seen. He still glanced around and only smiled when he spotted Taehyung then proceeded to wave at him. 

Taehyung waved back, trying to school his soaring heart.

The adults that were already on the field began emptying it and Isak guided the group through the field, some parents with them.

Suddenly, Taehyung then felt like time was slowing down and speeding up at the same time. He saw one of the adult players kicking the bouncing basketball with a loud curse. And he kicked it hard. So hard that it kinda changed trajectory? Taehyung's brain didn't have time to register that that he got up and started running toward the field. It was like his body was on autopilot. The ball was going fast, too fast, and if he didn't stop it...

If he didn't stop it, it was going to hit Yoongi on the head, with full force.

Taehyung shouted Yoongi's name but the kid only watched the ball coming towards him, probably too stunned to move. Taehyung knew he wouldn't make it but that didn't stop him from running as fast as he could, without losing sight of Yoongi.

All of a sudden, Yoongi disappeared in a black trail and the ball hit the fence with a deafening noise.

Taehyung finally arrived to Yoongi. He was nestled in someone's arms, still shocked. Taehyung squatted down, pulled the boy into his own arms and hugged him as hard as his heart was beating.

“Yoongi! God, Yoongi…“

He peeled himself from the boy, reluctantly and checked his arms, his head, his legs.

“Are you okay?“

Yoongi didn't answer but a pout pursed his lips and tears gathered in the corner of his eyes. He then started to sob.

“Are you hurt?“

New sobs.

“Yoongi, please, answer me… Are you hurt?”

He shook his head and Taehyung understood.

“Were you scared?“

Yoongi nodded and his tears doubled. Taehyung hugged him tight again.

“It's okay, it's okay! I'm here now, you're alright, little one, you’re okay…“

Yoongi stopped rubbing his eyes and wrapped his arms around Taehyung's neck. Only that gesture seemed to finally calm the frantic beats of Taehyun’s heart: feeling Yoongi close to him, safe. 

It was only then that the doctor realized the pother that surrounded them: Isak, his partner with whom he gave lessons and the mother of one of the kids were scolding the young man who hit the ball. He was looking at his shoes apologetically and glanced at Yoongi from time to time.

On their left, a man, dressed in a black turtleneck, black tight jeans and heavy boots, was watching the crowd, seemingly worried. Taehyung first thought was that he must be freezing with no coat. His second thought was that that man was beautiful. He looked distressed, the way he glanced around, frowning, as if looking for someone or something. But he was still very handsome with his big doe eyes, his little upturned nose and the mole that highlighted his lower lip.

Taehyung then understood that he was the man who saved Yoongi.

He buried his nose in Yoongi’s trembling body and made a mental note to thank the stranger as soon as possible, or even buy him a coffee — there was a foodtruck not that far from there. 

When Yoongi finally calmed down, Taehyung wiped Yoongi's tears away, everyone of them causing a crack on his heart. All he wanted to do was take Yoongi home and probably bubble-wrap him and never let him be in danger ever again. So he suggested going back home and postponing the lesson until next time but Yoongi shook his head, vividly. So Taehyung agreed, no matter how much it went against all his instincts, and Yoongi went back on the field where he was greeted by the black Bulls’ shirt girl with pats on his back.

After he made sure everything was okay, Taehyung finally stepped out of the field and looked for the man who saved Yoongi.

But he was nowhere to be found.

"Jeon Jungkook-ssi, hello!"

Jungkook frowned. It was Haneul's voice, Hanee's Dispatchers Team Leader, in his head and it was highly unusual that he was the one to call hil.

"Hello Haneul-ssi."

"Ah! I see you recognized me. I know your shift endend only a couple of hours ago but euhm…”

He seemed to be embarrassed or nervous about what he was going to say so Jungkook decided to ease him into it.

“Whatever it is, just say it, Haneul-ssi, I’m listening.”

“Okay, you- you’ve been summoned.”

Jungkook's lack of immediate response made the atmosphere more tense than it already was.

“So”, Haneul resumed, “please report to the headquarters, right now and ask for-"

"Now?"

Okay, things were maybe a lot more serious than he thought.

"Yes, it’s- I think it’s about the vengeful spirit but Leader Jang asked to see you."

Leader Jang Kanghoon was the Director of the Seoul area. He was known to be very kind but impartial in his decisions. Jungkook never met him before but he knew he was from the same era as Jungkook’s. 

“The sooner you're here, the better, there's quite the commotion here…"

“Okay, I’m coming.”

The black thread stopped buzzing against his wrist and disappeared.

Jungkook looked at the almost empty arena he was at. It was early in the morning but the slice of starless sky he could see from the window was still dark, as it always was in Maeul. He was already out of breath, since Haneul had called him in the middle of a training session but the prospect of meeting Director Jang prevented him from regaining normal breathing as quickly as he would have liked.

This does not bode well...

This thought was looping in his head but he preferred to ignore it.

He undid the bandages around his hands using his teeth, with sharp but orderly movements. After that, he took a quick shower and got dressed. He contemplated going back home to change into something a little more formal but he decided otherwise.
He just adjusted his bag over his shoulders and got on his motorbike.

His thoughts raced through his head, as he raced between the lights that lined the streets. The arena was on the outskirts and it would take him at least half an hour to get to headquarters. Being called by a Director was never a good thing. Some reapers had been sentenced to be eaten by the Imugi after malicious acts, getting personal revenge, or simply after a particularly badly handled case. 

Jungkook didn't know if he had mishandled Oh Sangeok's case but if he was called so urgently, he probably had more to blame himself for than he thought. Perhaps it was the fact of having made himself visible the day before? It was forbidden, of course he knew that. But it was the only way to save Yoongi. Oh Seongok deflected the ball and gave it abnormal inertia. Jungkook wasn't supposed to see them until after dark. But something had changed his mind — something he wasn't ready to admit to himself yet. And the main thing was that he had been right to do so. Who knows what might have happened to the child, if he hadn't been there!

He tried to look for the spirit, after that and even thought he saw it at one point. He still lost track of it.

Tightening the palms on the handles of his bike, he accelerated even more, eager to know what was going on.

The headquarters of the Korean Souls Escorting Bureau — or Hanyeongho for Hangug Yeonghon-ui Hogug, as it was more commonly called — was a small edifice and, unlike the other buildings surrounding it and the rest of the city, its walls were white. Only the traditional Korean tiled roofs gave the same vibe as the rest. Maeul had been built around it and, if the legend was to be believed, it was the only building whose walls originally belonged to the Living Realm. 

The doors opened by themselves as he approached.

Jungkook almost never came to Hanyeongho even though he worked for them. The last time was probably over 300 years ago when his Soul Notebook were given to him. Those notebooks were very personal items and had empty pages. It only filled with the names of all the souls a Reaper needed to collect for his day's work, when a Dispatcher finished distributing the quota of souls to escort to all reapers on duty. Therefore, the Reapers did not need to meet their Dispatchers and everything was done remotely.

Jungkook crossed the yard, went through the double doors, and paused, flabbergasted, to contemplate how much things had changed.

The contrast between the humble exterior of the building and the wealth and richness that reigned inside was striking. 

The structure had always been much larger than it looked from the outside. There was, of course, some magic at work.

But unlike before, red and velvety carpets with golden embroidery lined the corridors. Long pine pillars, of impressive diameter, supported the ceiling. Glowing tree leaves were delicately placed on the moldings of said ceiling so that the whole thing was pleasing to the eye. At the base of each pillar were four komainu — two open-mouthed and two not, all winged.

Jungkook felt out of place with his jogging pants, his pink hoodie and his still wet hair.

Opposite the entrance, a flight of stairs unfolded and split in two, leading to the upper floors. On the wall, a magnificent tapestry had been hung. It represented a young woman with magnificent black curls, double eyelids outlined with incredibly long lashes and green eyes rimmed with gold. She wore a black Hanbok with silver pleats and her posture was most solemn.

At least, that portrait was still there and Jungkook recognised Shin Samang, the Fate of Death. He stopped himself from looking at her for a long time, though, seeing how he felt she could see into his soul.

"Reaper Jeon?" asked a timid voice. 

It belonged to a man with a quiet and solemn posture. He had a shaved head and tattoos on his neck.

Jungkook nodded. 

"Follow me please."

The man led him through a maze of corridors and Jungkook was sure he would never find his way back alone. After what seemed like an eternity, they finally arrived in a large hallway. Sixteen pine wood doors, each adorned with a gilt plaque, lined three of the four walls.

The tattooed man knocked three times on the door, the nameplate of which read Seoul.

The door flew open and Hanee, presumably nervous, seemed to calm down at the sight of Jungkook. She opened the door even wider to allow Jungkook to enter. He nodded to the man who had accompanied him and walked into the room.

Jungkook nodded at Hanee then turned to pay his respects to Director Jang but stopped short. Behind the desk, a child sat on the chair. He wore a very sober three-piece suit, an electric blue tie with bananas and a benevolent look at Jungkook.

Jungkook smiled despite himself.

"Kook, this is Director Jang! He summoned you because we have important information about Oh Seungok."

Jungkook bowed deeply.

"Hello, Reaper Jeon Jungkook, nice to meet you Director Jang."

"Nice to meet you, Reaper Jeon. I heard a lot about you"

Jungkook didn't ask if he heard good or bad things about him because he knew that the reason he wasn't offered to the Imugi yet when he broke rules that often was because of Director Jang.

"I'm sorry for summoning you like this but we have a bit of a problem. Take a seat, please! You too, Hanee."

Jungkook and Hanee did as they were told.

“After all the incidents you reported to Hanee”, Director Jang explained, “I visited the family tree of that man, Oh Seungok. Turns out, he comes from an old line of shamans. Of course, it's not usually a problem. The thing is this family is not your common shaman clan… They’re Inugami-mochi.”

Jungkook knew what an Inugami was: a dog god or dog spirit. They were incredibly powerful but malicious creatures that brought good fortune and wealth. Although, he was sure that they disappeared a long time ago from the Living Realm and roamed the In-Between desert. He knew about a Reaper who tried to coax one and ended up severely hurt, several times. He won over that spirit though and Jungkook saw him at big gatherings, the dog at his feet. 

“Ah! This may explain the fact that his mouth looks like a snout! But, Director, how does that explain all the weird things that are happenning, sir?” asked Jungkook, rather impatiently but, at least he hoped, with all the respect he could gather in his voice.

The Director smiled and Hanee answered: “Oh Seungok was abandoned when he was a baby and inherited the dog spirit pretty late in life, when he was forty something. He never learned how to control his beast so the beast did what it did best: it learned to control him. He was vile enough, unstable enough and did enough bad things in his life for it not to be noticed by his entourage. We believe it ate so much of his soul that, when he died, it simply fused with the spirit. I don’t think we’ve come across something even remotely similar but again, after the Separation, all the spirits were reallocated here, in the In-Between. Oh Seungok’s family must have been powerful enough to hold onto their spirit or, even worse, recreate one.”

An Inugami was one of the only spirit that could be man made, so it was possible. But all of this was only theories. Nothing in what they said explained how they came to that conclusion and, more importantly, how to get rid of it.

Hanee and Director Jang seemed to understand his silent questions.

“When you said he combusted and disappeared without a trace”, Hanee explained, “it reminded me of an old legend. Kamis are supposed to be pure manifestation of the energy flowing in the universe, personified in beings. Just like Reapers, they were souls before dying so, contrary to other spirits, they can actually use that energy to teleport. When they do so, the use of their energy create friction and therefore flames. I'm not sure if we've come across a similar case before, to be honest…”

"The thing is...”, Director Jang hesitated. “An Inugami eating a soul has never been seen before. We don't know how he learned to do this or why he did it in the first place, so we're navigating uncharted territory. That's why we're removing you from your regular duties for now so you can focus on this issue. You will have a team at your disposal and everything you need. We have also sent a missive to Shin Samang-nim so that she can give us insight or help. In the meantime, our Shamaness has created powerful talismans to place in that child's home and school. We still believe that someone should always be by his side all the time, just in case.”

Jungkook began fidgeting with his hands.

“That’s… that's really great sir and thank you for your consideration but… I may have forgot to inform you of something.”

Jungkook gave Hanee an apologetic look and then stood straight and looked directly at Director Jang.

“I didn't think it was important before and I’ve been avoiding- okay, the kid can see me.”

“What do you mean?”, asked Director Jang.

Jungkook looked everywhere but at Hanee.

“Even in my true form, that child can seen me.”

“What?”

This time, it was Hanee who shouted, clearly taken aback. Jungkook remained silent, his eyes glued to the gyroscope on the Director’s desk, beside the golden plate indicating “Jang Kanghoon”.

“Jeon Jungkook! Did you reveal yourself to him? Did you- did you speak to him?”

“No and… yes.”

Jungkook finally looked at Hanee again.

“I- Oh Hyejin wanted to see if her son was okay so we went and he could see me but not her and-“

“Why am I only learning this now?”

Hanee's voice was contained but Jungkook could hear that it was more hurt and disappointed than reprimanding. And he felt really guilty. She hadn’t even asked why it wasn't in Jungkook's daily reports, only why she didn't know.

“I'm sorry, Noona, I- I just wanted to- I'm sorry.”

She stared at him long enough for Jungkook to start squirming in his seat. Then she turned to Director Jang, a look of nonchalance on her face.

“I'm sorry Director, I should have watched this case more closely. I trusted Reaper Jeon here, but clearly I shouldn't have.”

Hanee was petty, Jungkook already knew that but it still hurt.

“Noona!”

She raised her hand in front of his face, still look straight ahead of her, somewhere behind Director Jang.

“Not now, Reaper Jeon. We'll deal with that later.”

Jungkook lowered his head.

“That's not what's important right now, Hanee-yah.”

He crossed his fingers on his desk and looked at Jungkook.

“You said the boy could see you but not his own mother's spirit?”

Jungkook nodded.

“Alright, then we'll test it out, see if he can only see you or if he can see other Reapers. But whatever the outcome, I think it would be best for you to reveal yourself and get involved in his life in a way or another.”

“Seonbae!”

“Hanee-yah, I'll deal with the consequences myself”, he said, calmly.

“That's not it, it's dangerous! Kook- I mean Reaper Jeon would be more vulnerable in a visible state and- and it's against the law!”

“I know, Hanee, I know. But the Fairness Law is above all other laws. And we owe it to that child to give him the fair Death he deserves, hopefully after living his best life.”

Shin Samang-nim's obsession with fairness was common knowledge. Jungkook didn't quite understand why but everything the Fate did revolved around not taking a life without it being absolutely inevitable. 

Still, that wasn't what was on Jungkook's mind, at that moment: he was still shocked at the prospect of "getting involved in Yoongi's life in a way or another."

"The doctor," he said in a coarse voice. They both looked at him. "The boy's guardian. He's looking for a nanny."

He had heard Kim Taehyung talk about that with one of his friends, on the phone. 

Jungkook held back a chuckle. Centuries ago, the thought of staying home to care for a child wouldn't even have crossed his mind. But times had changed and so had Jungkook. If things had been different, he probably would have-

No, it wasn't the time to entertain that frightening thought that, he just knew it, was waiting for him, in a corner of his mind… Ready to suck him into a never-ending spiral of anxiety.

The director looked at him for a long time before smiling: “That's a great idea… All right! Then it’s decided!”

He leaned back on his chair and looked at Hanee, stroking his tie.

"Hanee-yah, see if Reaper Gong can forge some documents, I heard that was his specialty back then. Ask Johan if you need anything, I’ll make sure he knows you have full authority and access to our resources. Also, see if Uheok can test the child. Oh! And report to me once a day… or every time something happens. That would be it."

Hanee and Jungkook stood up, bowed respectfully, and left the room.

“Noona!” Jungkook pleaded as soon as the door closed behind him.

“Save it”, she barked rather harshly. “Or- no! You know this is the kind of information that could have helped us grasp the situation sooner because if he can see you then it means something runs in the family! So why didn’t you tell me? Don’t you trust me? Have I ever made it hard for you to confide in me? Ahhhh! I see… Am I that annoying so you can’t even trust me with something like that? You made me look like a fool! I give you the latitude to do whatever you think is right and only ask that you tell me everything! We’re friends, I know but I’m also your boss and I’m the one responsible if something happens to you or any of my Reapers on the field.”

“Noona! You know-“

“I don’t wanna hear it, Kook… Reaper Jeon. I’m out. If you need anything, contact your dispatcher, I’ll assign Haneul to you, as this mission is our top priority.”

She turned around and disappeared at the bend of a hallway.

Taehyung is tired but he still woke up before his alarm. Looking at the ceiling, he let his mind wandered to the ton of things he had to do that day. It was a monday, the day he returned to work, after accueilling Yoongi, and he wanted to do anything but go back to work. The last two week with Yoongi, taking care of him, reminded Taehyung how much he still loved to help. What he didn't love was bitter hospital durectors breathing down his neck and confining hom to the VIP cardiaque ward.

"You're our primary break winner, Kim Taehyung-said," he said almost apologetically once. "I know you'd rather do ELEPHANT, but think of all the medical equipment we bought last months, thanks to people you treated. Think of Nurse Do and Nurse Wei who kept their job, since the opening of the VIP cardiaque ward. We even hired à New pediatrician and two new nurses thanks to your team! You're helping much more with this, believe me."

And Taehyung knew the director was right. The new pediatrician was a very capable doctor, as he heard from the nurses and on the coffee room gossip. And nurse Do was so relieved to keep her job, Taehyung knew she was a single mom and had to take care of her own old aunt too. Nurse Wei was happy to have new nurses to share the workload because they were all overworked. Taehyung knew. But he couldn't help but feel a bit selfish too and reminisce of the days he felt he did something important.

Nothing could have prepared Taehyung to Jungkook fitting in their lives so easily. It’s been a little more than a week and it’s like he knew the boundaries and bearings Yoongi and Taehyung himself had already established unconsciously. Not that he was complaining! Their lives had only changed for the better since he was sharing their apartment.

Of course, Taehyung had his doubts, at first. Hiring someone with no experience to care for a child, that was probably not something a responsible guardian would have done. But Jungkook had saved Yoongi the day before, so he couldn’t be all bad, right? Plus, there was something about Jeon Jungkook… Something that made Taehyung let his guard down.

So, thanks to Jungkook, the apartment was definitely less messier, they had great meals all the time and Taehyung could go back to his usual hectic work schedule. 

But the most substantial change was Yoongi’s nightmares. 

Taehyung had warned Jungkook about them, the first night he spent with them because they were a daily occurence by now. Like clockwork, Yoongi woke up crying around four in the morning and Taehyung would try to calm him down, offer him warm milk with honey and tuck him to bed again. 

And that was what happened the first night Jungkook spent with them. It was twenty to four when Taehyung heard sniffles and cries coming from Yoongi’s room. He got out of bed as quickly as he could but when he stood on the threshold, he saw that Jungkook was already there, kneeling on the side of the little one’s bed, a hand on his back and another wiping up his tears. 

Taehyung smiled at what he was seeing, his heart warming unexpectedly and returned to his room, leaving Yoongi’s door ajar.

And it seemed that Yoongi didn’t have any nightmares afterward.

That may have explained the weird camaraderie that sparked between Jungkook and Yoongi. The boy was even calling him “Hyung”, where he was still calling Taehyung “Ahjussi”. 

Yes, yes, Taehyung was jealous. He knew he was probably overthinking everything again but he couldn’t help doubting himself. Maybe there was something he was doing wrong with Yoongi for him to be more comfortable with Jungkook? Taehyung knew he wasn’t the most fun person in the world but he thought Yoongi and him had fun! They played some video games, went to the library, watched sports and piano recitals on the tv… He was happy Yoongi was getting adjusted to Jungkook that easily but sometimes, he couldn’t help but feel left out.

***

“Tomorrow? Ah! I can’t wait to see you! What time do you land?”

“Yeobo! What time we’ll arrive there?”, Taehyung heard his mother ask his father, on the other side of the line and the world. “Ah! Ten pm!”

“Oh? I have an operation scheduled then… What a shame! I would have liked to pick you up at the airport!”

“Ah, don’t worry, Adeul! Jin already said he would send Hoseok! Let’s all have dinner at home on Monday! Joon said he had someone to introduce to us, too!”

“What? Who, Ahn Huiyeon?”

“Ah yes, that was her name!”

“Really?”

Taehyung was baffled. Namjoon never introduced his partners to their parents. Not even Jimin and they dated for more than three years!

“Waaah! I can’t believe this!”

“Why? Did you meet her, already? How is she?”

“She’s… great! Really! I just- I didn't realize they were at this stage of their relationship, it’s all…”

“I see! And you? Do you have someone to introduce us to?”

Taehyung kept silent for a moment. He hadn’t told them about Yoongi yet. He thought telling them on the phone wasn’t really a good idea and he knew his parents: if they knew, they would have taken the first plane to Seoul to support him. 

“Yes, yes! As a matter of fact, I do.”

“What? Ah! Adeul! I’m so-“

“No, Eomma! It’s not what you think!”

“What do you mean?”

“I guess you’ll understand when you see… but it’s not a partner or anything like that.”

It was his mother's turn to remain silent.

“Eomma? Yeoboseyo?”

“Okay! I understand… I’ll see you in two days then!”

“Yes! Hug Appa for me, please!”

“Yes, yes! Take care of yourself, my little bear!”

"He didn't tell me, I'm not sure I can let you in..."

"I'm a detective, wait, I'll show you my badge," said the giant, reaching to his side.

"Oh! Detective Kim Namjoon of Seocho Police Station!”

That was little Yoongi who wiggled his way on Jungkook's side to look at who was at the door. Jungkook stepped slightly aside but still put his hand protectively on Yoongi's shoulder.

“Oh! Yoongi! Hi! Long time no see…”, said the stranger, cute dimples popping on his cheeks.

“You know him?”, asked Jungkook.

"Yes, he's Ahjussi's hyung!"

“And this is my-“

“HYUNG!”

The three of them looked at the other way of the corridor from where the sound came: Taehyung, disheveled, breathless, came out of the elevator.

"Oh! Taehyung-ssi!”

“Why are you all standing in the hallway?” he asked, barely breathing correctly, when he got to them.

“Your babysitter here is very protective of your house so he was checking my ID and all…”

Jungkook's cheeks were red from embarrassment.

“I’m sorry, I only-“

“It's okay, I appreciate it!”, the detective hastened to say. “With a kid in the house, I would have done the same!”

"No, you wouldn't because you're very trusting, which is really weird for a police detective, by the way, Hyung! But I'll pretend you didn't say that so please, let's continue this very intersting conversation inside the apartment, okay?"

As if he had just remembered that he was blocking the door, Jungkook stepped aside and let everyone enter.

“Will you stay for dinner, Namjoon-ssi?”, he asked, a small idea in mind.

“Mmhhh… I don’t know, really…”

"Oh, please, Hyung, stay!" Begged Taehyung, removing his jacket.

“Okay, I’ll call my partner to tell him not to wait for me…”

Jungkook made a superhuman effort not to jump up and down in joy and, Yoongi's hand in his, he sped off into the kitchen. He was going to prepare a nice little dish for Namjoon, just to apologize for his icy welcome. After a quick search in the fridge, he pulled out carrots, zucchini and everything he needed to prepare some kalguksu. He also took out all the banchans he had bought the day before.

“Hey, kiddo, wanna put them in these?”

“Yes, Kookie Hyung!”

And Yoongi, sitting on the high chair, began to arrange them in small plates, using chopsticks, his tongue adorably sticking out of his mouth.

————
"You didn't tell me your babysitter was so…" Namjoon began, sitting on the couch, out of the ears of the younger ones.

“So… what?” Taehyung asked, arching an eyebrow, sipping on his glass of red.

“So… wow! I don't have the words, really!"

“Hyung!”

Taehyung knew it. 

"What? Ohhh, is there something between you two? I get it, I get it… No wonder you literally ran here!”

Even though he wanted to protest strongly, Namjoon's mocking tone left Taehyung speechless. He closed his mouth open in surprise and shook his head.

“Don’t you already have a thing with… What’s her name again? Oh yes! Ahn Huiyeon!”

"Huiyeon and I are not serious... And for once, it's not because I don't want to!"

"Really?"

“Mmmhhh!” agreed Namjoon. "She's at a point in her career where she finally feels like she's making a difference... So a serious relationship is the least of her worries!"

"No, what surprises me is that you want something other than a fling for once…"

“I don't know... I don't have time to think about it, really, with work and everything... Huiyeon and I are... how to say it? Comfortable? Yes, easy and comfortable.”

Taehyung thought about Jimin and Namjoon's old relationship which, indeed, was anything but easy nor comfortable, according to them. The two put so much pressure on each other that they ended up blowing it all up when things got a little too serious.

Namjoon seemed to understand who Taehyung was thinking as he asked:

“Jimin’s okay?”

"He's still super mad at you for literally cutting him out of your life but he's fine otherwise..."

"I was crazy about him, Taetae-bear! Staying his friend and seeing him build something with another, thank you but no!”

"But, if you're not together anymore-"

"We broke up because he had life plans that didn't match with mine, not because I stopped loving him! Today, nothing would make me happier than to become his friend again! I've moved on, I'd be happy to see him and know he’s happy no matter who he’s with! But at that time, I couldn’t…”

“Well then, what prevents you from contacting him now?”

“The fact that he probably blocked my number? The fact that he hates my guts?”

“Pfff! Bullshit! You know him better than me, Hyung! You know he would love to have you in his life again!”

“No, I don't know… It's been three years since we broke up and even with everything that happened to you, even if we were both there for you when you needed it, talking to each other was difficult, weird even… It's been a year since I even saw him and people change so, no, I don't know…”

He looked at his brother, maybe a little sad.

“But I'm not here to talk about my love life, Tae…”

“Oh? Are you here to talk about mine, then? Silly me… Thinking that, for once, you wanted to see me! Hyung, I'm hurt!”

Namjoon smiled at Taehyung’s fake pout but his smile seemed forced, and for the first time since seeing his brother that night, he noticed dark circles under his brother’s eyes. Taehyung understood that, indeed, Namjoon’s visit was anything but a courtesy visit.

“Hyung? Is everything okay?"

“I- What about you? How's it going?"

Okay, maybe things were not okay, because Namjoon never liked beating around the bush.

"Hyung, you're freaking the shit out of me, just spill it!"

Namjoon sighed, defeated. He lifted his back from the backrest of the sofa, leaned forward and rested his elbows on his thighs.

"It's Gong Myeonsik."

At the mere mention of that name, before he could even register who Namjoon was talking about, Taehyung felt his whole body start shaking. It was light but it was there. He looked at Namjoon for a few seconds before letting out a sigh he didn't know had gathered in his chest.

“I have a friend in the immigration department… I helped his kid pass the police exam so he owes me a favor or two… I asked him to keep an eye on a list of names, just- just in case and-“

At the sight of Taehyung’s  trembling hands, Namjoon stood up, walked around the coffee table and sat down next to Taehyung on the big couch. He then put his arm around the younger’s shoulders and hugged him tight. Taehyung was grateful for him: he knew that his brother was not too fond of skinship and displays of affection but feeling him against him, like that, helped the doctor ground himself in the moment, in his living room, helped him keep his mind from wandering into the myriad of frightening possibilities, into the spiral of anxiety that threatened to swallow him whole.

“Taehyung-ah,” Namjoon said gravely, barely like a whisper. "I'm here... I won't let him hurt you, I promise..."

“H-hyung…”

It was more of a sob than a call but Namjoon didn't seem to notice — didn't mind. He just hugged Taehyung even tighter and Taehyung buried his nose in the crook of his brother's neck and didn't hold back his tears.

“Dinner is rea- oh? Tae-Taehyung-ssi! Are you okay?”

Taehyung jumped slightly and straightened up, losing Namjoon's arm around him. Without looking toward the kitchen entrance to his right, toward Jungkook so the younger couldn’t see him, he wiped away his tears.

"It's okay, Jungkook-ssi!" he said, sniffling loudly, a forced smile behind his cracked voice.

"Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you, it's just that- uhm... Yoonie is hungry and it's almost his bed time and it’s going to get cold and-"

"It's okay, Jungkook-ssi!" Namjoon said, standing up. "Let's give him a few seconds, okay? Did you cook? We could have ordered!”

He said all this while heading to the kitchen but Jungkook barely noticed him, busy staring at the doctor who couldn't stop his sobs.

“Detective Kim Namjoon of Seocho Police Station, look! Hyung made Kalguksu!”, Taehyung heard from the other side of the kitchen door.

“Oh wow! I love kalguksu! Did you help him?”, asked Namjoon.

“No, but I put the-“

“T-Taehyung-ssi… Can I do something, maybe?” Jungkook’s voice covered Namjoon and Yoongi’s ones.

"No, don't worry, Jungkook-ssi, it'll be okay, let's eat!"

He got up abruptly and headed to the kitchen, his head down but Jungkook grabbed his wrist when he was about to go past him. Taehyung finally looked at him, at the younger’s intense gaze and the numerous questions in his big doe eyes.

“You know you can lean on me, taehyung-ssi, right?”

“I-“

Taehyung's thoughts were all over the place. With Myeonsik back, was it wise to keep Jungkook and Yoongi with him? Was he going to have to separate from them? Taehyung grew accustomed to the duo and couldn't see his life without them, now. Well, he knew it was only temporary, but losing them so suddenly made his heart ache. Still, he didn't want to put them in danger, he had enough of-

"Right?"

Jungkook's voice had become smaller but more pleading. Desperate. Taehyung looked into the brown of his eyes and reveled in the kindness and courage he found there.

"Yes, I know it, jungkook-ssi, I know it... Let's eat now, okay?"

———— 
“Ahjussi! Are you crying?”

Taehyung lifted his head to look at Yoongi and smiled at him.




“Yeah, Namjoon Hyung told me some very lame jokes but I still laughed until I cried… So these are happ




They ate mostly in silence, despite Namjoon and Jungkook’s efforts to make conversation. Yoongi was observing Taehyung attentively and, the moment the doctor sat in front of him, he asked why he was crying.

Taehyung was nervous. It was sunday and they were at the door of his parents’ house, right outside of Seoul. Taehyung was dressed in beige pants and a green sweater under his trench coat. Yoongi was in jeans and a marine dress shirt with cute little cats all over it and he held Taehyung’s hand firmly. Clearly, he was anxious too. Behind the two of them, Jungkook was in tight black jean, white sneakers and white t-shirt. Even with the chilly weather. Still, Taehyung couldn’t understand how he could dress like that. He had a big bag over his shoulder. 

Taehyung se mit à genou pour vérifier - pour la 46eme fois - que la chemise de Yoongi était bien boutonnée. 

“Taehyung-ssi… It’s fine.” réassurance bla bla bla + pkoi taehyung a des doutes (première fois qu’il fait qq chose depuis qu’il a rompu avec l’autre, il était lethargique, il a peur que pour ses parents ça ne veuille dire qu’il a l’intention d’avoir des enfants ou d’adopter or il sait que la situation avec yoongi est temporaire…)

- Taetaeb- oh? 

His father’s look fall onto Yoongi who looks at the old man owlishly. His father looks at him, pretty much confused.

- How much time did we spent in Costa Rica ?

Taehyung laughed finally, his father’s joke dissipating his fears. It was his family, the one who brought him up, the one who accepted him fully, when he was broken and non-verbal, when he caused their son’s accident and when he came out.

- Obviously, you stayed too long cause I missed you !

He hugged his father who returned his embrace, kissing his forehead even if his son was a head taller than him.

- Come, come ! Hi, little one ! My name is ELEPHANT!

Yoongi bowed very respectfully then almost yelled “Hello ! My name is Min Yoongi !”

- Nice to meet you, Yoongi ! And who’s your friend over there, Taetaebear ?

Taehyung ignored the raised eyebrow of Jungkook at the pet name.

“This- this is… euhm…”

Jungkook bowed à son tour.

“Nice to meet you, sir ! My name is Jeon Jungkook and I’m the nanny !”

“Oh ? Nice to meet you, young lad! Come, come, don’t stay in there, you’re probably frozing to death cause you obviously forgot your coat! I’ll see if Minsun could bring you something from one of the boys old clothes, I’m sure we can find something to warm you up!”

“Where’s mum?”

“She’s in the kitchen, with Jinnie! You know how they get, talking business strategy and boring stuff ! Oh and Joonie is somewhere in the garden with his girlfriend ! I can’t believe he’s finally bringing someone ! Tell me, Yoongi ! Do you like to paint ?”

Yoongi looked at Taehyung, like asking for the permission.

“What are you looking at me for ? I don’t know if you like painting, I can’t give you the answer !”

Yoongi giggles and nodds towards the old man vigourusly.

- I knew it ! Let’s go to my atelier, I’m sure we can find some acrylic in one of my cabinets ! Jungkook-ssi ! Would you like to join us ?

Taehyung knew what his father was doing and he was beyond grateful for that.

- Absolutely, ELEPHANT-ssi !

Jungkook le suivit dans le couloir et il l’entendit dire “What a lovely house you have there, Kim-ssi !”

“Nonsense, call me ELEPHANT !”

Taehyung essaya de respirer normalement et rentra dans la cuisine.

“Taehyungie ! I missed you so much, my baby !”

His mother contourna the counter and hugged him tight, nuzzling kisses on his cheeks.

“I missed you too, mum! How was Costa Rica ?”

“Fruitful! We secured some important matière première supplier so I’m pretty happy !”

“I meant the country, not the deal !”

“Oh ! I wouldn’t really know ! Your father could tell you better than me ! But we went wine tasting one weekend and the scenery was breathtaking ! So yeah !”

“Yeah appa said they were in the gardens ! But where’s Jin Hyung? Appa said he was with you in the kitchen ?”

“He was ! Hoseok called and he’s in the veranda taking the call…”

She eyed the veranda.

“When will these two stop dancing around each other, mhhh? I want to have grandchildren, for god’s sake!”

Taehyung wanted to laugh but ça lui resta en travers de la gorge.

“I mean, no pressure, of course, I just want my boys to be happy, you know ? Oh ! I met Huiyeon ! She’s a delight ! Namjoon seems really happy !”

“Yeah… Speaking about that…”

She looked at him.

“I’m euhm… Do you know what Huiyeon does for a living ?”

“Euhm yeah she’s a ELEPHANT.”

“Yeah, that’s actually how I met her… Like… There was this kid that lost his family and euhm… You know, I just-“

“Ahjussi ! Look what I draw !”

“-gi, no ! Oh… Hi !”

Yoongi had barged in the kitchen, Jungkook on his heels. Taehyung looked at him, very proud and smug expression on his face, showing him a round brown poodle of color ? 

His father finally burst into the kithchen.

“I’m sorry, Taetaebear”, he said, out of breath. “He’s a fast little runner !”

Taehyung smiled and looked at his mother, wearily.

“I was married, you know?”

Les mots échappèrent sa bouche avant même qu’il ne s’en rende compte. Et encore une fois, il fut surpris par la facilité avec laquelle il laissait tomber sa garde à la simple présence Jungkook. 

“You were?”

“Yep! We were this perfect couple… We met at med school, and were pratiquement attached by the hips at a point… He was my best friend, my first love. I had all my firsts with him, actually: first time in a club, first kiss, first hangover, first time and first heartbreak.”

Taehyung sighed.

“I loved him dearly because he was very supportive of me and genuinely wanted me to be happy… There’s nothing I didn’t want that he didn’t give me or, at least, try to… Material things, I mean. He comes from a very wealthy family, he’s the first born of the Shin family, the one who owns half the private hospitals in the country. I say material things because, for example, we dated for 5 years before he finally accepted that I meet his family. Not that it went well! His parents didn’t want him to have anything to do with me… I- I’m an orphan, you know? I was adopted, when I was Yoongi’s age, I think. We fought a lot because of his family, because, no matter what, he just refused to let me go, promising me that he would talk to his parents and make them see how wonderful I was, that I just had to wait. So I waited, because it hurt more not to be with him than being rejected by his family and being belittled by him sometimes. My family loved him, of course! Joonie, my brother, is also adopted and, despite being a detective, when he decided to look for his biological parents, he encountered a lot of closed doors. And Sanguk, he helped. I didn’t even asked him, he did it without telling me about it. Even if he always found things to say about Joonie or about my parents. I thought it was because he was just overprotective of me… I was used to that side of him, after all: I was very extroverted when I was in high school, loved going out, meeting new people… But he- I don’t know. He used to ask me how he wasn’t enough for me, if I needed other friends. So he would forbid me from going out or meeting friends. Especially male friends. At first, I resisted. Because who the hell was he to dictate how I live my life and who I hang out with? But, with time, you just stop because it’s just tiring to argue. And I can’t lie, I refuse to, honesty was and still is very important to me. So I stopped and I lost all my friends but Jimin. I’m pretty sure he thought Jimin was out of my league and that’s why he never said anything about him…”

Taehyung laughs but it’s bitter.

“So yeah, after a year, he finally popped the question, we eloped with our families to Canada and had a big wedding there — not the kind I wanted but… yeah, it was still great! We were happy… Or so I thought… Because we stopped arguing about his family — who warmed up to me, for some uknown reason. And I don’t know but his expectations of me just spiked up. Like he would be pissed if I had night shifts and I found out he even tried to move my shifts so I can be home at night. Which would have been wholesome if he didn’t do it behinf my back. He also became very judgemental and yeah… No, actually, he always were but with fewer arguments about his famly, without him being an absolute angel and clinging to me, it was like i finally discovered these parts of him. His controlling habits… Like, he literally threw tantrums if I ate chips or ordered pizza because I didn’t want to cook. So it hit me, one day. That I didn’t love him anymore. That i didn’t love him for years, actually. It was our second year of marriage. And I had a breakdown because of that. Like he was such an important part of my life, we had projects together: this house in Jeju that we were renovating, the project of adopting together, the project of moving to Canada for 2 years so he can study management there and I can gain some international experience… So I decided to stay. Because, that was love for me: a choice. You sure don’t get a say with whom you get attracted to. And infatuation and attraction, they fade away, eventually. Love is when you choose to stay, despite that. And I loved him. I was also afraid of being alone, to be honest… I got so used to him being there and supporting me. But I wasn’t aware of that, at the time. The only thing I knew is that i was staying and that I had to tell him. Like I said, honesty is very important to me and I thought I owed him the truth, I owed him the choice of staying or not, too. Not everyone want to live in a marriage build on only tenderness, friendship and trust, some people actually need romantic love. I realized recently that I did need to tell him because of more selfish reasons, too: I gave him a chance not to choose me, so I can break free. To choose for me because I was brave enough to face my feelings — or lack of — but not what it entailed: divorce, being alone, losing the comfort of going back home to someone… and losing him. Losing him was above anything I could handle. he was my best friend, the person who knew me the best, the person I knew the best. My north star, my bearings… He listened. And he told me that he would reconquer me and stayed. So did I. And our lives continued like nothing happened for a while. Sure, he became a lot more controlling and jealous but I felt guilty not loving him, so I just put up with it.
Until I did a check-up a year ago. We were married for 4 years, I told him I didn’t love him anymore, 2 years prior. We were still having projects and dreams and working together to make them come true. It was a routine check-up I did sometimes when I felt more tired than usual or just to make sure everything was okay, you know? So, when the results came back, I didn’t understand because it had traces of sleeping drugs. I couldn’t have taken them more than a day before the test and that night, I remembered having dinner at home with Sanguk and that we drank one of his favourite red wines. It downed on me that, for a year or so now, wine would make me unusally sleepy. I’ve never been a heavy drinker, of course, but I could handle one glass of red! But not anymore… Sanguk would just laugh and brush it off as “me becoming old”, when I brought it up with him. 
I didn’t know what to do so I talked to Jimin and Joonie about it. I was freaking out because it was a heavy dosage, the kind that can make you dependant and I could lose my license! Jimin was convinced it was Sanguk but Namjoon refused to believe it. They both came with me and, while I took Sanguk to the room so I can pull the truth from him, Namjoon and Jimin stayed on the living room. And you know what? He didn’t even deny it. So I asked him why and he told me that he couldn’t trust me anymore, that he was living in the fear of losing me, every day, because I didn’t love him anymore. So he had to check my phone and I had it fingerprint locked. So, the only solution was for me to be knocked out so he can unlock it and check if I was cheating on him. He told me with such light tone. He could have been speaking about the weather, it wouldn’t have been different. It was appalling. I couldn’t even scream nor cry. I just stood there, completely stunned. Then i felt fear like i never feared anything in my life. So i just stood up and tried to leave but he stopped me. I tried to get out of his grasp and he became somewhat violent. So Jimin intervened and knocked him out and Joonie and him took me out of there. Joonie discovered that he hid cameras almost everywhere in the apartment, in the hallway, in my office… Obviously, I quit working for that hospital where he knew a lot of my colleagues and found a job at that shitty hospital with Hoseok. Sanguk fled to Canada a few days later when I filed a complaint against him. And that brings us to today!

“There’s no proof, Kim-ssi. It’s Yoongi’s word against Jisung’s.”
“Actually, we can ask the little Yulia, can we? Isn’t she concerned by all of this, since it’s her backpack?”
“Still, it would be her word against Jisung, Kim-ssi.”
“Oh, I see how it is, now. Jisung’s word must weigh as much as Yoongi and Yulia’s words, is he the son of some big donator, here?”
“I don’t like what you’re insinuating, Kim Taehyung-ssi.”
“And I don’t like that you only hold my Yoongi responsible where clearly, something is going with Jisung and I have the right to be concerned about that!”
“Yoongi will be suspended a week instead of three days.”
“What? Why?”
“Because I said so! You’re only Yoongi’s guardian, I’m not sure you’re qualified to question our methods nor our system! And clearly, something’s wrong with what you do with Yoongi as we can see his marks dropping and him developing bullying behavior! We’re the ones concerned, Kim-ssi.”
Taehyung was stunned. 
“That’s- that’s not true, Principal Choi, ahjussi is very kind to me, I promise I’ll do better at school, I’ll-“
“It’s okay, Yoongi, don’t worry. Principal Choi, maybe I didn’t introduce myself clearly before… Here’s my card.”
Taehyung saw with pleasure how the principal’s jaw dropped.
“Kim from Haebalagi Cosmetics?”
“Yes! I’m Yoongi’s guardian and I’m still learning but I’d do whatever it takes for him to go as far as he can with his talents and intelligence. I’m sure with the right support, he’ll do amazing things.”
“Ah yes, yes, Kim-ssi, I’m sorry, I didn’t know, please-“
“With all my due respect, principal Choi, you can save it. But clearly you missed a big chance here, my parents, my brothers and I, as you already know, love to donate to schools or finance kid’s programs through our foundation. It’s a shame, really… Because we look for genuinely impartial people who do not fear standing up to bullies.”
“Wait, Kim-ssi, we can-“
“I believe we took too much of your time already, I’ll get Yoongi back in here in a week, then, have a good day!”
“Oh?” Taehyung startled because he completly forgot the teacher behind him. “Yoongi is still coming tomorrow, isn’t he? It’s the zoo school trip and his late mother already paid the fee and signed the documents.”
“Ah yes, I believe so, thank you for reminding me, Dak-ssi! See you tomorrow!”
“Wait! Wait, Kim-ssi!”

Oh snap!

Interludes

Mutual proposal

Namjoon was sleepy, his head lolling against the car’s window. Huiyeon baissa le volume de la musique, sans quitter la route des yeux mais cela sembla réveiller Namjoon.

“Did I wake you up?”

“No, I was just- resting my eyes…”

“Though week at work?”

“Yeah… But it’s Taehyung… He’s worrying me, to be honest.”

“Why? I mean… He seemed okay at dinner?”

“He can fool the parents but not Jin and I, you know?”

“Is this about his crazy ex?”

Namjoon sighed. 

“Yeah… Like I don’t believe he’s in immediate danger, otherwise, I would have probably told you about it, because of Yoongi. But yeah… He seemed anxious. And I hate seeing him like that! I’m his brother but ever since all of this happened a year and a half ago, I feel guilty for not… seeing the signs? But also for not making that bastard pay!”

“Wah! Joonie, calm down! You know it’s not your fault!”

“Yeah, I’m not even allowed to work on those cases, I just keep an eye on this but I wish- I wish I could do more!”

Huiyeon smiled sadly and put her right hand on Namjoon’s accross the ELEPHANT.

“It’s okay, I’m probably overthinking again…”

“At least, he seems distracted enough with Yoongi and Jungkook-ssi!” tried Huiyeon.

Namjoon snorted.

“I guess so!”

A comfortable silence s’installa dans la voiture, troublé seulement par les accords de guitare d’une chanson pop et les lumières qui illuminaient leurs visages en rythme.

"Uhm... i was thinking..."

"Yeah, you tend to do that with that vig brain of yours," Huiyeon teased.

Namjoon smiled but he was still uneasy. Huiyeon frowned: Namjoon was tense 

“You know… He- I mean- He made me want to have- euhm… that.”

Huiyeon squinted her eyes slowly, always on the road.

“What do you mean?”

“A kid.”

She looked at him, très rapidement. Lui, ne la quittait pas des yeux, guettant sa réaction.

“A family”, ajouta-t-il après quelques secondes. “With you.”

“Namjoon…“

“Wah! What’s with the government name?”

She smiled, faiblement.

“You know I’m not ready…”

“I didn’t say now!”

Il commença à jouer avec ses doigts, toujours dans sa main.

“I’m not ready either! Our jobs are far more important right now and I know it! And I love you and even if someday I’m ready and you’re not, it’s okay! Having a kid is not a goal of mine, we can be a family of two! It’s technically not a-”

Huiyeon commença à rire.

“I’m rambling again, isn’t it?”

“Yeah but you’re cute so it’s okay!”

Il porta la main d’Huiyeon à sa bouche et déposa un délicat baiser sur sa délicate peau.

“What I want to say is- when I imagine my future, you’re there, by my side and I want you to be with me, forever.”

“Kim Namjoon! Are you proposing, right now?”

“Yeah, I think I am- I mean, no! I am!”

Huiyeon éclata de rire.

“I want that too, Joonie…”

“Don’t answer me yet! I have to kneel and buy you a ring and-“

“I don’t care about that! This proposal is perfect! It’s so us! And I wouldn’t have it any other way! So yes, I accept!”

Le sourire de Namjoon dessina des dimples sur son visage et il regarda Huiyeon, le coeur battant.

“I love you!”

“Love you too, Joonie! You make me happy!”

"Oh? Tokki! What a nice surprise!"

The man behind the counter was tall and had handsome features. He had quite a small face with the kindest eyes Jungkook had ever seen, despite them having xxx pupils, just like those of a snake. Or a cat. Jungkook was happy Minho hyung liked him a lot and didn't look at him like the prey he was. Minho was a gumiho and coukd definitely gobble Jungkook's soul without the young nan being able to do anything about it.

But the worst of it all wasn't the guy's appearance but Jungkook's blush at the affectionate nickname.

"When will you stop calling me that? Seriously... I'm not 7 anymore!"

"Definitely, but you still look like a little rabbit, so your demand is irrelevant. "

JungKook sighed with the beginning of a smile. "Have you been well?"

"Kinda... but i guess you haven't, if you're here."

Jungkook's blush deepened even more.

"I've really been busy hyung, you know how it is..."

"Yeah yeah, mister CEO of the gates. How can i help you?"

It was a péjorative nickname sone of the people of the underworld called him, Jungkook knew. But strangely enough, in Minho's mouth, it was affectionate and Jungkook felt weirdly proud.

"I need Taemin hyung and i was wondering if you knew where he was?"

Minho looked pained but quickly regained his composure. Jungkook even doubted if it wasn't his imagination qui lui jouait des tours.

"JungKook–"

"I know, hyung," JungKook interrupted. "But i really need his help, a kid is in danger and if i don't do anything, he might die..."

"Is he supposed to die?"

Jungkook decided to tell the truth. Gumiho could detect lies anyway. 

"Minho hyung, I'm on official business, i really need to find the kid."

"Still, you know the rules: we shouldn't interfere with the living, if he's supposed to die"

"He's not, i told you, I've been mandated by the halmeoni herself! I'll bear the responsibility for everything, i just need Taemin hyung's help. Please, rvery second counts!"

Minho looked at JungKook intently, like he was reading his soul. Finally, he sighed.

"He– he works for Jieun, that's all i know but, Tokki, i doubt he'll help..."

"Still, i have to try, hyung," JungKook answered, determined.

Jungkook bowed the headed towards the shop's door but, before they could exit the store, Minho spoke again.

"Tokki-yaa! If everything goes well, you know, you can tell the halmeoni how this humble servant helped..."

Jungkook chuckled sabs humour mais ne se retourna pas.

"Yeah, yeah, i know the drill. If anything goes wrong, I'll bear all the responsibility but if the outcome is good, I'll share the glory."

"Good, good... Also..." something in Monho's voice made Jungkook turn to face him again. 

"Euhm... if Taemin helps you, he'll need... if he needs anything– could you like... you know... remind him I can help?"

JungKook felt the sparks of frustration ignite deep within him. Those two hyungs, Minho and Taemin, they were too old for this kind of bullshit.

"Seriously, hyung, I'm not gonna play cupid for you! Just call him if you're worried!"

"I can't, you know he wants nothing to do woth our world anymore..."

"Everyone knows that it doesn't mean he doesn't want you anymore!"

Minho smiled sadly at JungKook who deflated at the sight.

"Sorry, i shouldn't have said anything... it's not my pkace. I'll– yeah... I'll tell him."

"Thanks, Jungkookie. Come visit this hyung again, i miss doting on you."

JungKook smiled genuinely, bowed again then exited the store. Il serra son bracelet dans sa paume et se concentra. Quand il rouvrit les yeux, il était quelque part à ciel ouvert. Le vent soufflait fort, portant le son des mouettes et l'odeur de la mer chatouilla les narines de JungKook. Il y avait pas mal de conteneurs devant lui et, sur la gsuche, un bureau qui ne payait pas de mine, dans un bâtiment qui ne semblait tenir que par la force de sa volonté et rien d'autre .

JungKook se dirigea vers le bureau et toqua à la porte avant de la pousser.

"Welcome! Oh? Isn't this our JungKookie?"

The woman behind the desk au fond se leva et le contourna pour s'elancer vers JungKook et le serrer dans ses bras.

"Oh my god! How long has it been? Two years? Look how much you've grown, you're practically a man now!"

JungKook retourna the embrace.

"Noona, I'm 30 already!"

"And I'm– well i stopped counting after 400, but still! 30 is a baby!"

"You still remember humans rarely live past a 100, right?"

"Yeah, it's a shame really, but I'm pretty sure that's what makes all of your lots charm, you know? The uncertainty of your mortal lives, it's quite disheartening but that makes you so full of life!"

Jungkook kept silent because he didn't have time for philosophical debates but didn't want to anger Jieun. He had so much respect and affection for her. She was a siren and had powers beyond anything JungKook could begin to fathom, and a kinfness ans understanding only as deep as the ocean.

"Well, if you're here to see Taemin, he's out on the docks but it's almost the end of his shift, if you wait a little–"

"I can't wait, noona! There's a kid's life on the line and i need to find him before it's too late."

"Okay, okay, I'll call him for you..." she went yo her desk and sat on it, while dialing a number on the telephone terrestre. "Is the kid supposed to die, though?" she asked iver la tonalité. 

"If he's not, I'll be the one paying the price, you don't have to worry about your involvement."

For a second, the air stilled and became unbearable to breath.

"You know that god you serve has no authority or agency on me, she can try but she would have to bear the consequences. Not even death can stop the relentless waves to break on the shores."

She hung up abruptly. JungKook knew he offended her.

"I'm sorry noona, i only meant that i won't cause you any trouble..."

Jieun's gaze softened and the atmosphere warmed again.

"Oh? I'm sorry then little one, i misunderstood you."

Jungkook almost laughed at this being which was born of the foam on the crown of the waves bur was still tiny as fuck calling him "littke one" when he was talker than her (necessary???)

She sighed.

"He's coming."

"How do you know?"

"If he's already headed here, he usually doesn't bother answering his phone. Oh? Here he is!"

Jungkook turned and effectivement he saw his Taemin hyung coming with two other people, chatting and laughing. Taemin was... changed, to say the least. The kast time Jungkook saw him, he was famished, half dead, voughing blood sous la lueur d'une chandelle et les mains expertes mais tendres de Minho. The Taemin he was looking at now had gained weight and seemed healthy. Jungkook felt a pang of guilt squeeze his heart.

Taemin said his goodbyes to the other persons before he opened the offuce door.

"Noona, you called– oh..." he stopped dead on his track when he saw Jungkook. 

"No."

"Hyung, please..."

Taemin se retourna et marcha de là ou il était venu. Jungkook le suivit.

"Just hear me first, hyung, please!"

Taemin ignored Jungkook and continued walking. Ils étaient pas loin du village de contenairs à présent. 

"It's really really important, there's an innocent kid's life on the line!"

Taemin stopped dead in his tracks so abruptly, jungkook almost lui rentra dedans.

Taemin se retourna et ce que Jungkook vit sur son visage le devasta. Taemin n'était pas en colere ou indifférent... Ses yeux etaient emplis de douleur qui menacait de rouler sur ses joues.

"Please, Jungkook... please, don't ask that of me, it's been two years and the nightmare has just begun to subside..."

Taemin was a powerful seeker. He could, with the right vessel, find anything or anyone wherever it may be. He was born with that gift but it was a gift to everyone but himself: Taemin had been exploited since he was a child who barely learned how to speak. He was sold to the highest bidder to find lost treasures, missing persons... the downside to his gift— his curse, really, was that to seek an object, his soul had to separate from.his body. This was extremely dangerous not only because he could die but also because his body could be possessed (ELEPHANT inverser ici). Plus, his seeking made him untethered to this world, meaning he was not only harrassed by the living but also by the dead. And Jungkook, all powefful that he was, still had nightmares about the monsters lying on the kther side, even if they couldnt physically harm him. So Taemin, whose soul wandered between those dead and deadly nightmares... Ju gjook could never understand thr pain of it all. And he felt guikty to ask Taemin to help again, after finally escaping his situation and gaining to protection of the Sea. 

Still, jungkook thiught about Yoongi's little hand in his, his curious eyes and stern attitude. And his heart vrumbled in his chest.

"I'm sorry, hyung... I'm really sorry... you know i would never ask tbis of you if it wasn't important. He's – his name is Yoongi and he's chased by a ve geful spirit. You know what those can do if they touch yiu... he's been under my protection but he's been kidnapped and i don't know where he is. The sunset is near and if i dont find him soon, i dont le know what will become of him... I'm sorry hyung, im so sorry but could you help me, please?"

Taemin was fully crying at this point. 

"Do you have a vector?"

A vector was something or someone related to the person or object you were seeking. 

"Thank you, thank you hyung..." Jungkook said, feeling a mixture of shame and relief, while opening his bag.

"Here," il tendit le sac de Yoongi à Taemin.

"Okay, let me tell Jieun noona that i wont be able to work fir the next few weeks and we can do it in the office afterwards."

Jungkook nodded, la tête bien retranchee dabs ses epaules.

Jieun n'accueilla pas ka nouvelle de bon cœur. Taemin avait conseillé à Jungkook de rester dehors donc tout ce que Jungkook entendit de leur conversation etait les voix qui s'étaient elevees et le regard nour que Jieun lui lanca en sortant du bureau.

"I hope it's worth sacrificing two years worth of efforts... you better never show up again your face around here, Jungkook. You're not welcome anymore."

"Noona, enough!" Taemin shouted but Jungkook didn't need Jieun's word to feel like shit.

Jieun se dirigea vers le bord du Xxx et sauta dans l'eau. ^^

Jieun leur abandonna le bureau.

Taemin poussa un des bureaux contre le mur et posa le sac par terre. 

~~~ à développer

"Are you sure it's Yoongi’s backpack?"

"Yeah, why?"

"I can't sense anything in this, no emotional attachment whatsoever. Is it something he's had since long?"

"To be honest, i thought so but i don't really know."

"We need a better vector, something or someone the kis is attached to, you know?"

Jungkook frowned. They were nearing the end of the afternoon and even with days becoming longer, they only had a couple of hours before the sun set. And somehow, he knew the answer. 

"Hyung, you mind going to Seoul with me? There's a strong vector to Yoongi there..."

Taemin se releva et tendit la main à Jungkook pour l'aider à se relever. 

"Okay, let's go."

They took Taemin's car to Seoul. Les embouteillages de fin de journée commençaient à se faire sentir. Jungkook appella Taehyung.

"Hyung, any news?"

Taehyung’s voice was hollow and a bit high-pitched. Jungkook felt guilty abandoning him into that situation alone.

"Kook, hum... no, still nothing. There was no call for a ransom or anything like that. Euhm... the cctv around the school shows that the man took him in a car and they're trying to look for it. They issued an amber alert."

"Yeah i saw, i received the text... that's good, if anyone sees him, we'll know."

"Well, they're not telling me anything really but i heard some of the police officers say that they're flooded with calls.. but i guess nothing relevant came out of it sonce they're still sat behind their desks now..."

"I'm sure they're doing everything they can, hyung... "

"I wish you were here..."

Taehyung had whispered the last few words and Jungkook couldn't really tell if they were real or just a product of his imagination.

"I'm sorry, what?"

Taehyung breathed loudly into the phone, like he just awakened from a long slumber. 

"Nothing... Euhm gotta go, they're–"

"I wish i was there too, hyung.. but i promise i wasn't out doing anything but try to find Yoongi, just wait a bit, okay? I'm coming. I'm coming, hyung."

A sniffle. Was Taehyung crying?

"How are you trying to find him? Do you– do you know anything?"

Jungkook pinca les lèvres avant de passer une main sur son visage. 

"No, i swear, i would've otherwise told the police but.. uhm.. hyung, do you trust me?"

"Of course, yeah!"

The immediate answer, not an ounce of hesitation in Taehyung’s voice melted something in Jungkook.

Taehyung was angry. No, scratch that, he was mad. Standing above the sink, in his bathroom, his eyes fixed on the drain, he was trying to calm the tremor of his hands and his throbbing heart. It was his fault. An innocent kid was almost harmed today and it was his fault. The thought only made the uncontrollable movement spread to the rest of his body. So Taehyung clung to the sink to avoid collapsing and looked up to look at his reflection in the mirror: he was pale but his cheeks were red. So did his eyes, but that was surely because he had cried in the shower.

He heard someone knock on the door.

That was probably Jungkook that wanted to use the shower, too. He inhaled, tried to compose himself then lowered his head. Maybe if he stormed out of the bathroom, if he avoided looking at jungkook, the latter wouldn't see that he had cried? That was his plan, at least.

The plan didn’t work.

He opened the door, mumbled an “it’s yours!” and walked past Jungkook when the younger seized his wrist, delicately, preventing him from disappearing. Taehyung wanted to flick his hand to get rid of Jungkook’s grip. He wanted to run away and hide in his room. He wanted to disappear and not show Jungkook this part of him. That’s probably why he refused to turn his head and face him.

“Hyung…” Jungkook’s voice was warm and steady. “Are you okay?”

What Taehyung needed, on the other hand was quite different. He needed someone to hug him, hold him tight, and tell him everything was going to be okay. And that’s probably why he only shook his head, holding on tears until his quavering legs couldn’t hold him anymore. Jungkook caught him up and supported him, a hand still around his wrist, an arm around his waist. Taehyung turned his head so he can hide his tears in Jungkook’s soap scented neck.

There, in the middle of the corridor, they stood for a long time, the younger whispering calming promises to Taehyung, between kisses on his forehead. 

“Come one, now, I’ll take you to your room”, murmured Jungkook when Taehyung calmed down enough for his body to stop shivering. And the older just nodded, his mind too foggy to think much less to resist. 

He let himself be led and soon found himself in his bed, his covers over his head. His head was resting on Jungkook's chest, who was lying next to him, his arms holding him and protecting him from the world more effectively than his duvet.

Anger always made Taehyung tired and left him sleepy. And Jungkook’s body’s warmth didn’t help. His eyes were already fluttering but he clearly heard and understood the younger’s last words:

“It’s not your fault, Hyung… It’s not your fault.”

Taehyung fell into a sleepless dream.

Happy day
Taehyung woke up to the sound of small birds singing at his window. He was terribly hot and bathed in sweat, which never happened to him. It took him a moment to realize that it was because of the arm around his waist and Jungkook's body stuck to his.

“Oh”, he thought.

It must have been early in the morning, if we were to believe the semi-darkness that reigned in the room. Contemplating the small windows that lit up as the minutes passed, he tried to breathe as calmly as possible to control his thoughts. Because their two bodies were intertwined in the duvet, Jungkook's smell enveloping him like a small soap bubble and his breath was regular and pleasant against his neck.

But mostly because Jungkook's body was hot against him and Taehyung was sure the younger one had an erection.

Taehyung was a doctor. He knew that morning wood was nothing sexual, just a simple surge of hormones. But it had been a long time since he had had anyone in his bed. The hard feeling against his ass had ignited a fire in his lower abdomen and he was getting hard himself. But unlike Jungkook, Taehyung's erection wasn't just a hormonal reaction.

And it was wrong.

So he tried to calm down, to concentrate on the city waking up outside his window, to think about all the work he would have to catch up on the next day, to-

Jungkook groaned and shifted in his sleep and Taehyung froze, realizing that in his desire to keep his thoughts away from the young man, he had started fidgeting.

"Mmhhh.. G'morning, hyung..."

Jungkook pulled Taehyung towards him, snuggling even closer, nuzzling the back of his neck.

"Why so squirmy? Need to pee?"

"Sorry, did I wake you up?"

"Mmhh, 's okay, I have to go make breakfast for the little monster anyway..."

"He's not going to school today, maybe you could let him sleep in? He had a lot of emotions yesterday..."

At the thought of Yoongi getting kidnapped because of him, Taehyung felt the simmering anger overflow again.

Jungkook chuckled against his neck and Taehyung's anger disappeared in the blink of an eye.

"I'm not sure you know our Yoongi, because-"

"AHJUSSI! AHJUSSI!"

Repeated small knocks were heard against the door. They looked alarmed and both Taehyung and Jungkook sat up, worried. Yoongi opened the door and rushed into the room, his cheeks bathed in tears and a sad pout gracing his little mouth.

"I can't find hyung, I-Oh!"

Yoongi's eyes widened when he saw Jungkook and then he burst into tears. Taehyung wanted to comfort the child, cuddle and calm him down, but Jungkook was quicker: he got up in a hurry, crouched down in front of the little boy and hugged him.

"Hey kiddo, I'm here, what's going on?"

"Hyu-hyung wasn't in his room and- and I thought- I thought someone kid-kidnapped you!" Yoongi's explanation was punctuated with sobs. Jungkook discreetly turned his head towards Taehyung and gave him a worried look. The events of the day before had shaken the child much more than they thought.

"Kiddo, you know my secret, don't you?", Jungkook whispered simply in Yoongi's ear — but the morning silence made Taehyung hear him anyway.

The child nodded, crying silently now.

"So you know I'll never let anyone hurt me, huh? I won't let anyone separate us, either… You know that, don't you?"

"Buh-but..."

Yoongi snorted loudly.

"What if they are stronger than you?"

Jungkook pulled away from Yoongi and looked him in the eyes, a smile on his face.

"Hyung has a black belt in taekwondo and trains every day... Have you seen those muscles?"

Taehyung avoided looking as much as possible.

"Don't worry, kiddo, hyung won't let anything happen to you or to Taehyung hyung, okay?"

Yoongi nodded again and wrapped his chubby little arms around jungkook's neck. Jungkook hugged the little boy tighter and with a grunt carried Yoongi and stood up. Part of his t-shirt got caught in one of Yoongi's pajama buttons and Taehyung caught a glimpse of his perfectly flat tummy and the crease just above his shorts that were a little too low. When he looked up, he saw that Jungkook was looking at him, a silly smile on his lips. The doctor felt his cheeks heat up.

"Go brush your teeth, hyung! The little monster and I are going to make breakfast!"

He turned his head towards Yoongi.

"Smiling pancakes, anyone?"

Taehyung didn't even want to know.

"YES!"

And the two kids left the room, leaving a mortified Taehyung to his thoughts.

√v^√v^√♥

When Taehyung emerged from the bathroom again - where he had spent a good quarter of an hour splashing cold water on his face to calm the flush in his cheeks - he found Yoongi sitting on the high chair, cutting his pancake methodically, frowning with effort. Jungkook, he was sitting opposite, a steaming cup in his hands, both elbows on the counter and watching the child, ready to intervene at the slightest opportunity. When Taehyung sat down on the chair next to Yoongi, he found a huge pancake on his plate. A few blueberries acted as eyes and mouths and Taehyung understood that the smiling pancakes were not an expression but literally smiling pancakes.

To the left of his plate, a pleasant smell emanated from a hot cup of coffee. Taehyung shot a grateful look at Jungkook who just smiled at him.

"Your pancake was prepared by Yoonie, hyung! By himsself!"

Taehyung's eyes and heart widened.

"That's not true, you flipped the pancake for me!" protested the child.

"But that's just because the pan is too heavy for you... You still made the batter all by yourself! And you personally placed each blueberry in his pancake, right?"

Yoongi didn't say a word, he grabbed his fork, looked down and started eating silently. Taehyung imitated her with a smile, throwing "mmmmmh!" and "yums!" sometimes.

"So what's the program today?" Jungkook asked, after a few sips of tea.

Both Taehyung and Yoongi looked at him with the same suspicious and concerned expression.

"What? You really thought we were going to stay locked up in such good weather!?"

Taehyung and Yoongi looked out the window, in perfect sync and Jungkook burst into his Elmo laugh.

"You two really make a pair, you know?"

Both Taehyung and Yoongi lowered their heads and each focused on finishing their pancake.

He sipped his drink, swallowed and was about to say something when Yoongi interrupted him in his tracks: "Can we have cheese tteokbokki for lunch?"

He looked at Jungkook but Taehyung knew the question was meant for him. It still hurt him to see that the child didn't trust him enough or was not yet comfortable enough with him to ask him the question directly. But they were moving in the right direction and that was the most important thing. Baby steps, the doctor reminded himself.

"Of course! I've wanted to for a long time too!" Taehyung said, full of sincere enthusiasm.

Yoongi smiled and looked at him furtively.

"Let's just go to the park, take a walk and then go eat, okay?"

"If Yoongi is okay with it, sounds like a plan!"

When they finished eating, everyone went to their room to get dressed. After 45 minutes, Taehyung was sitting on a very empty park bench, a bandana holding back his curls from falling in front of his eyes, his book which he had brought with him with the firm intention of reading it long forgotten next to him. His eyes were fixed on the two youngsters playing seesaw. Yoongi laughed out loud whenever the seesaw moved, one way or the other. The child was laughing so loudly and so hard that Taehyung was afraid he would lose his balance. Jungkook's feet didn't leave the ground whether he was on the top or bottom of the seesaw. He was trying to surprise Yoongi by adopting a frantic pace then stopping to move abruptly and it was going pretty well... Taehyung wanted to join them. But seeing Yoongi so comfortable, he decided against it.

Around noon and after visiting the small zoo section of the park – where Yoongi was delighted by every animal they encountered, the trio headed to a small restaurant not far from where they were. Jungkook swore they served the best cheese tteokbokki in the world but, seeing the shabby and modest appearance of the storefront, Taehyung had doubts. He wasn't even sure the business was legal...

Not to mention that the restaurant was empty. That didn't stop Jungkook AND Yoongi, who were ahead of him, from moving carefully between the tables, taking care not to disturb anything. They sat down in a corner, not far from the kitchens, at the far end of the restaurant and ordered a cheese tteokbokki for three - "With extra eggs, please, hyung!", Yoongi pleaded, some soondae and fish cakes and even some kimbap to a very cantankerous ahjumma.

The service and cleanliness left something to be desired but Taehyung still had to admit that the food was divine! And seeing Yoongi enjoying eating warmed the doctor's heart.

They were now on the street again, just outside the restaurant.

"Okay, I admit, I admit... It was very good!"

"I told you, Hyung! Jungkook knows all the best grubs!"

"What's a bouiboui?" asked Yoongi.

While asking his question, the child did something he had never done before, nonchalantly, as if his gesture hadn't just caused Taehyung's heart to swell three times its original size in his chest! Yoongi had just grabbed Jungkook's hand - so far nothing exceptional, these two were attached to each other all the time! - and, with his other hand, seizes that of the doctor.

The two adults looked at each other, surprised. Taehyung decided not to say anything – not because he was holding back tears, not at all! But because he was afraid to break the moment.

"It's a place like we just ate in, sweetie," Jungkook replied, visibly holding himself back from cooing.

"Oh," Yoongi said simply. "I like the bouibouis, then!"

The adults laughed heartily as they walked towards home.

Home. It had definitely become more than just a house, since Yoongi and Jungkook moved in with it and Taehyung smiled to himself. He hated that apartment when he visited it, hated leaving half his things behind in his old apartment, hated that move and move in because of the circumstances that led him to do it: running away from his ex. Even today, Namjoon blamed him for not having any plants or personal items in his home. But that was probably because Taehyung didn't feel at home in his house. He knew it was because he lived in constant fear of Jaehwa coming back and not wanting to settle down. To settle meant to leave a trace of its passage and to become attached. It also meant making any escape more painful. He had already experienced that once... If he could avoid reliving that again, he would do anything to avoid it.

But, now, seeing the two youngsters talking about taking a detour to the ice cream shop, both of their hands tied and swaying with their movements, Taehyung thought that getting attached wasn't such a bad thing. It made him want to protect himself and protect this little bubble they had built together.

Squeezing Yoongi's chubby white little hand tighter, which still hadn't left his big, tanned one, he forced the younger ones to stop. The two then looked at him with their eyes that were way too big for their small faces and for Taehyung's sake.

"Before going to the ice cream shop, I would like to take you somewhere...", said the doctor smiling. And he led them across the street.

They walked another block before stopping in front of a small bookstore that didn't look like much. Taehyung pushed open the door, followed by Yoongi then Jungkook, and was assailed by the peculiar smell of books that all bookstores had.

"I know you like going to the library but...I come here often," Taehyung explained, holding Yoongi's inquisitive gaze. "It doesn't look very big but they have a huge basement and a special space section..."

At the mere mention of that word, Yoongi opened his mouth.

"You have a budget of 50,000 won, you can buy whatever books you want!"

The child continued to stare at him, as if frozen in place. Taehyung was then seized with a doubt: had he made any mistake? Wasn't Yoongi happy with his sudden little surprise?

Jungkook crouched down and the movement caused Yoongi's head to turn towards him.

"What are you waiting for? Go ahead!"

As if waiting for a signal, Yoongi then grinned broadly, let go of their hands and began to sprint towards the stairs.

"Walk slowly!" Jungkook urged.

Yoongi didn't slow down: he stopped short. He then turned around, took the opposite route – walking – and threw himself against Taehyung's thighs. Surprised, the doctor didn't react, at first, and just looked for Jungkook's look, a little alarmed. His heart was bound to drop, given the frantic knocking against his ribcage. And even though Taehyung was a doctor and knew that was not possible, he was still worried about the health of his heart muscle!

Before he could react and put his hand on the child's curls, the latter released him and turned to Jungkook, shoulders straight and eyebrows knotted.

"We'll still eat ice cream after that?"

Taehyung chuckled: "Are you sure you're not related? I... you are real stomachs on legs!"

"Don't pay attention to him, kiddo," Jungkook said simply, waving his hands dismissively towards Taehyung. "And yes, of course we will eat ice cream!"

Yoongi smiled again and took the stairs, Jungkook on his heels.

Taehyung let them stroll and sat down on the small sofa in the reading corner, not far from the large window. In the meantime, he had grabbed and paid for about twenty packets of fluorescent star-shaped stickers.

"You know how to please him! He's so happy that at one point I literally saw him vibrate..."

It had been a quarter of an hour since the youngest had disappeared and Taehyung had taken the opportunity to close his eyes and take advantage of the warm rays of the sun that filtered through the lettering of the window. The resident cat of the bookstore had barely taken up residence on his lap a few minutes ago. At the sound of Jungkook's voice, the latter stood up, stretched, his claws clinging to Taehyung's jeans, and jumped down to rub against the younger's ankle. The latter crouched down and began to stroke the beast under the chin.

"I have no merit...", Taehyung replied. "I also had very particular obsessions, when I was younger!"

"Oh? What kind of interests?"

Taehyung smiled.

"This is the kind of information I will take with me to the grave."

"Oh, come on, hyung! I won't judge, you know me!"

"I-It's not that special, I just-It's nothing, really!"

"If it was special for you, then it's special!", replied the youngest of the tac au tac.

Taehyung sighed.

"At the beginning, I dreamed of being an entomologist..."

"That's the study of insects, right?"

Taehyung nodded yes.

"Many find it rather... disgusting..."

The doctor thought back to those summer days when Jin, Namjoon and he spent their afternoons chasing butterflies and collecting worms and ladybugs in the garden. No matter how much their mother yelled at them to wear their caps and t-shirts to protect themselves from the sun, nothing helped. And she had even more trouble convincing the three brothers not to bring the critters back into the house. Jin always brought him books on certain particular specimens... Books not really suited to Taehyung's age, at the time, but which he nevertheless devoured, eager to know and full of curiosity.

"Mmhh... I'm not afraid of insects and I think some are really fascinating... But I sure don't know enough to carry on a conversation, sorry!"

"Oh! n-no! Um... Don't be, it's okay". Taehyung watched as the sun glinted off Jungkook's golden skin and starry eyes. He was handsome, with his simple, white, short-sleeved t-shirt hugging his muscular arms and emphasizing his broad shoulders and girlish waist. He was wearing high-waisted blue jeans torn everywhere and Taehyung thought he detected a piece of tattoo on one of the youngest's thighs. Startled, he looked up and saw that he too was being watched with eyes full of tenderness.

"Ahjussi! I'm done!"

Startled, Taehyung cleared his throat and blushed heavily, Jungkook looked to the side and grabbed his tomato red ears and the cat hissed and abandoned them to head for the stairs. Taehyung then abruptly stood up and walked towards the cash register.

Yoongi had managed to drag a dozen books there, some of which seemed very heavy with knowledge and pages. Taehyung stopped in front of the child and put a hand on his head, smiling.

"Did you find everything you wanted?"

"Yes, thank you, ahjussi!"

"When you're done reading them, we'll take another trip around here, would you like it?"

Yoongi literally had stars in his eyes, which Taehyung took as a yes.

The doctor helped Yoongi pack up some of his books and put them in a bag but most of them ended up in Jungkook's backpack. The latter put it on his back, as if it contained only feathers and advanced in the street.

They ate their ice cream, happy that the shop was also empty of people at this hour. But, after all, they were on weekdays...

Suddenly, when they were a few meters from their apartment building, Jungkook let go of Yoongi's hand and ran towards a plump little woman who was staggering up the entrance steps under the weight of shopping bags.

"Aigoooo, Seolhwa-ssi! I told you to use the wheeled shopping cart I gave you last time! You'll end up hurting your back from carrying such heavy bags!"

As he spoke, he grabbed the two bags, despite the lady's vehement protests.

Taehyung glared at Yoongi, one eyebrow higher than the other.

"Who is it?"

"Oh, it's Madame Baek, she's the upstairs neighbor! Hyung and I help her with her shopping sometimes."

Jungkook was able to balance the two bags and his own backpack as easily as a tightrope walker and Taehyung looked at him for a long time. This man had the gift of always surprising him, definitely. No one could have such a good heart, be so selfless. A real little angel.

They finally arrived at the apartment and Yoongi began to put away his books - "in alphabetical order of author", he had explained, all serious, from the height of his 134 cms, to Taehyung who stood in the frame of the room. gate. Jungkook was sitting at the foot of the bed with his legs crossed. The doctor chooses this moment to place the stickers on Yoongi's desk.

"I also thought you could decorate your room with stars..."

Yoongi's eyes alternated between Taehyung and the sticker packs. They ended up landing on the older one, though, below furrowed brows.

"Is- Is it true? Can I?"

"Yep! Have a blast!"

Yoongi let out a cry of joy such as Taehyung had never heard him do before. He picked up the stickers and began to examine them. Jungkook then abruptly stood up, startling the other two.

"I'll get a stepladder, you tell us where you want to put them, kiddo!"

"Mmhh, I'll leave it to you, I have work to do and-"

"Oh? You're not helping us, hyung?"

Jungkook's voice sounded disappointed and the look Yoongi gave him too. But Taehyung really needed to study a procedure and consult some studies for an operation scheduled for the next day. He too was disappointed but he really couldn't afford to make any mistakes tomorrow.

The apologetic look he gave them answered Jungkook's question and Taehyung smiled apologetically.

A few hours later, Jungkook knocked on his bedroom door.

"Hyung, I cooked dinner, are you coming to eat?"

Taehyung looked out the window: Night had long since fallen. And he hadn't noticed. No wonder he had a headache, he must have been reviewing the steps of the operation for hours, seeing the incisions and the internal anatomy of his patient in his head, even going so far as to perform the gestures in his hand, almost feeling the weight of the scalpel in his hand. But for something like half an hour, the words no longer made sense: he needed a break.

Taehyung just smiled at Jungkook and followed him to the kitchen. Jungkook had cooked pasta with cream and shrimp. They ate, the sounds of chewing and the clinking of cutlery drowned out by their conversation. Yoongi was telling Taehyung – talking directly to him! And looking him in the eye! - how Jungkook placed Vega too far and /to the left/ of Lyra's parallelogram, laughing like it was the most absurd thing in the world. Jungkook just shrugged his shoulders and hands, an apologetic look painted on his features.

When they finished eating, Jungkook went to tuck Yoongi in while Taehyung did the dishes. After a few minutes, though, the babysitter came back into the kitchen and stood in front of him.

"Hyung, Yoongi wants to say good night to you."

Taehyung stared at Jungkook for a moment, not believing his ears.

"You scored a lot of points today and the stickers... That was the coup de grace! I think seeing you worrying about him yesterday helped him open up a bit to you. .. What are you waiting for, hyung? Go ahead!"

"I was just waiting for you to finish talking but sometimes I forget what a chatterbox you are doing!"

Jungkook gently tapped Taehyung's arm who left his dishes to dry and followed Jungkook to Yoongi's room. All the lights were off except for the very faint nightlight that the doctor had bought the child on the first day. Taehyung couldn't help staring at the wall and ceiling, now strewn with stars by the hundreds. It could be seen that Yoongi had spent time delicately placing the constellations on the concrete vault of his room and Taehyung felt proud. Proud of this little man tall as three apples who finally opened the door to his universe, giving him a glimpse of his stars. And Taehyung could see that they were as bright as suns at their zeniths.

Taehyung anxiously approached Yoongi's bed, who was silently reading a book. When the adult sat down on the bed, Yoongi put his book aside, pushed his blanket aside, got on his knees and slowly approached Taehyung. He then hugged her, whispering a little "good night, Taehyung hyung" then retired as quickly as he could and hid under his quilt.

"Good night, buddy!"

And he walked out of the room, leaving Jungkook to tell Yoongi a story.

Taehyung decided he was too tired to go back to his books. He poured himself a glass of red wine and sat down on the couch. He swirled the liquid around in his glass and drank a few sips here and there, his thoughts definitely elsewhere..

He felt oddly good, as if the horrific events of the night before had taken place years ago, not just hours. Perhaps it was euphoria to see Yoongi trusting him, but in the haze of his scattered thoughts, an idea - no, a desire - imposed itself: If Ahn Huiyeon did not find the child's family, Taehyung was ready to adopt her.

This thought didn't even scare him, even though he was barely formulating it. He saw himself helping the child grow and develop. He could move into a house, too, with a garden, so Yoongi could run around or play on the swing that Taehyung would build for him. He would help her with her homework and navigate life to become a good person. And he and Jungkook would be there for Yoongi, just like his parents had been there for Taehyung.

Taehyung shook his head. He knew this was not a decision to be taken lightly. He also knew that it wouldn't always be so easy of course! But he was sure he could overcome anything for Yoongi.

"As long as I have Jungkookg, I-"

Taehyung frowned. Adopting Yoongi had nothing to do with Jungkook! Why did he have such thoughts? Why was he thinking about-

"Hyung?"

Taehyung blinked and came to his senses. A hand - Jungkook's - waved in front of his eyes. He raised them to the youngest, still a little lost.

"I asked you a question, three times!"

"Huh? Oh, sorry... What did you ask me?"

Jungkook was sitting on the sofa too, one leg bent, his foot under his other thigh. So his knee touched Taehyung's thigh.

"I asked you what you were thinking..."

"Oh! Just to my surgery tomorrow."

Taehyung hated lying. It was wrong, of course, but it seemed even more awful when the lie was directed at angelic doe eyes full of sincerity.

"I'm sure it'll be fine, Hyung!" Jungkook replied simply, even though Taehyung would have cut his hand that the younger one knew he had lied.

ELEPHANT

"Yeah..."

Taehyung couldn't help it: his eyes locked on Jungkook's labia minora. The latter, as if by reflex, licked them and began to bite the corner of the lower one. The chest of the oldest then leaned a little forward, in spite of himself, a bit like an invitation. And Jungkook answered it, eager, delicately joining their mouths.

It was chaste at first. A simple touch of the lips, as if each was testing the ground, waiting for the other to retract. Then the peck turned into two then three then-

Then heaven opened up for Taehyung.

Jungkook tenderly licked the doctor's mouth and the doctor responded by parting his lips. Their kisses became more intense, more greedy. Jungkook's hand was now resting against Taehyung's waist while Taehyung's was on the other's thigh, his fingers playing with the threads of the jeans where he was torn, surreptitiously stroking the patch of skin under his fingers.

Jungkook then stopped short and Taehyung felt the heat rise to his cheeks. Had he exceeded any limit? What was he talking about? Yes of course! He had just kissed Jungkook! There were a lot of boundaries he had crossed, the last 2 minutes! His spiraling thoughts were stopped by surprise at Jungkook's question.

"Are you drunk?"

Taehyun wanted to answer yes, blaming that kiss on alcohol. A simple mistake. But everything in him refused to consider what had just happened as such. He knew very well what he was doing. He hadn't really thought about it, as usual. People thought he was thoughtful and always in control of his emotions, but he knew better. His emotions were still all over the place, threatening to overflow, their seething shaking the lid he was struggling to keep in place.

"Hyung?"

No, kissing Taehyun was anything but a mistake.

"No, I only had one drink...Why?"

"Oh, just to make sure you don't take advantage of your inability to do this..."

And he put his free hand on the back of Taehyung's neck, pulling him into a fiery kiss while the one that was already on Taehyung's waist slipped under his shirt.

The older man's heart was pounding, thudding against his chest as a few butterflies flew into his stomach, tickling his senses and making his desire soar.

Taehyung no longer held back. He moved his hand over Jungkook's skin and this time stroked it deliberately with his thumb. Between two kisses, Jungkook slipped a "Your room or mine?"

This is how the two of them found themselves glued to each other, Jungkook his back glued to the door of the room Taehyung - "My room is closer..." - Taehyung walking his hands there anywhere they could reach until they landed on Jungkook's belt, clutching his high waisted jeans.

Taehyung didn't hesitate: he undid it, opened the 5 buttons and interrupted their kisses to squat on the ground and put his eyes at the level of Jungkook's protuberance. He then began to kiss her, through the fabric of the youngest's boxers - who let out a small moan.

And what music to Taehyung's ears! He was ready to do anything to elicit other reactions from the other, curious to know his slightest noises as well as his every nook and cranny.




# Untitled

========

Taehyung’s own bulge is tightening his pants and he really want to touch himself. Au moment ou il va descendre le boxer de jk, il leve les yeox vers lui et le voit dans toute sa splendeur: accoudé sur le matelas, la tete légèrement en arri_re, les joues rouges, les yeix flittering, les poings serrant la couette. Taehyung le trouve beau et se fige, surpris par le spectacle. Jk qui roilait encore un peu des hanches semvle se rendre compte que qq chose ne va pas et ouvre les yeux. Des yeux pleins de tendresse et de-

Taehying se releve brusquement.

I- This- I don't think this is okay... tae dit, les yeux fermes, une main sur la hanche et lautre sur son front comme une casquette.

What? Hyung... are you okay? Do you- did I do something?

Il est blessé. Taehyung le comprend quand il recontre le regard de jk a nouveau et il comprend la nature de la blessure du plus jeune.

No, fuck- no, no? Kook... it's really not you! à quatre pattes, il rampe vers Jk et s’adosse au cadre du lit, attirant jk contre son torse. You didn't do anything wrong... you did- you're beautiful and i- I really want to pin you against themattress and do unspeakable things to you, make you moan my name until-

Tae can see jk’ dick twitch.

Ok, not helping, he thinks.

Then.. then why?

Jk lost his hurt expression but now he seems worried.

I don't know, kook.. maybe we should talk abt it first? I'm your employer and this is not- also I don't want you to think this means something it's not and-

While he was talking, jk had buttoned his pants again and regained some composure.

It's okay hyung, I understand.

You do?

Yes! You're overwhelmed and rightfully so. I'm sorry I led you to-

You didn't led me or anything, I'm an adult kook.

Can wr cuddle?

What?

You seem fidgeting and tbh I'm a little freaking out cause I'm afraid this will make things awkward between us and I need a hug so... we still can talk about this, even under the covers... mmmh?

Okay;..

i’m just going to change onto pajamas or something.

Jk entreprend de se relever mais TH est plus rapide et le saisit par un pan de son t shirt. jk se fige.

jai des trucs que je peux te preter... restes.

Taehuung avait bien conscience qu’il didn’t really make sense, ses actions non plus. Mis la dernière chose qu’i voulait était de voir partir Taehyung. jk ne bougeau pas. Taehyung avala la distance qui les séparaient et entoura la fie taille du jeune homme, mettant son menton au dessus de son épaule.

désolé, kook. i mean it.

Les épaules de jk, jusque là bien droites s’effondrèrent et il posa ses mains sur celles de taehyung, accrochées à sa ceinture. Après deux ou trois reniflements pendant lesquels taehyung ne bougea pas d’un poil, ce dernier se retourna à nouveau, tout zsourire.

Je peux piquer ce que je veux dans ton placard?

bien sur!

ils se leverent tous les deux et là ou taehyung prit un t shirt et un short en entreprit de les enfiler, jk regardait toujours parmis ses vetements. Taehyun était déjà installé dans le lit, le dos collé au cadre, bien confortable contre ses oreillers lorsque jk, sans gene aucune, se débarrassa de son jean et de son t-shirt. Taehyung se retint de justesse daaler de travers. son seeve venait à peine de se calmer mais il ressentit la chaleur désormais familière s’emparer de ses entrailles. jk mit alors un ancien t-shirt olivatre, orné de petites plantes dorées, beaucoup trop large. c’était jimin qui lui avait offert, il y a 3 ans. Jungkook ne choiit pas de short ni de pantalon*.

The sun is seeping through the airy white curtains, bathing the room in dancing light. Feathery shadows moves with the wind blowing through the window.

Jungkook is focused on his cake batter, frowning, eyes squinting at his phone where he's reading his recipe from. The sun's rays light up his face, his little moles, his soft brown curls. Taehyung, leaning on the counter, his forearms laid flat, his hands playing absentmindedly with the not so long-abandoned whisk, stares at him.

Observes him.

Jungkook is handsome, of course, Taehyung knows it all. He has very well working eyes and even if he didn't, he would know by hearing how everyone talks about Jungkook, how anyone who meets him for the first time holds their breath as if the air was too much light to breathe, as if the gravity field shifted to draw all eyes to him. Taehyung knows. But it had never affected him before. Not like today anyway because his mind is completely blank, if not for the desire to walk around the counter, take Jungkook's hand in his, get rid of his bowl full of dough, put another hand on his face, caressing his face, his little moles, his soft brown curls. Dive into the hazelnut of his eyes. Caress the younger’s lips with his.

And that certainly wouldn’t be all, judging by the heat that latches at Taehyung’s lower abdomen.

The doctor looks away, feeling guilty for having such thoughts. But Jungkook lets out a small growl which catches Taehyung's attention again and his eyes find Jungkook again.

"I forgot to turn on the oven!"

"Oh? Leave it, I'll do it!”

"Thanks, Hyung! You have to put it at 180°C, please…"

Taehyung nods and walks over to the device to his left and turns it on.

"Can you open the bag of chocolate chunks too, please?"

Taehyung returns to his place and do as he’s told. He hands the package to Jungkook who signals him to put it next to the bowl while he spreads butter on the walls of his pan, concentrating on his task. And Taehyung takes the opportunity to observe him again. Jungkook was the same size as him, in other words, the ideal size to kiss him. The ideal size to push him against the counter and put his hands on the hips of the young man, caress his brown skin under his t-shirt, finally feel his abs, kiss him silly and play with his-

Taehyung jumps up and Jungkook looks at him, his eyes full of excuses: he's just let fall his pan loudly taking  – luckily – Taehyung out of his dangerous train of thoughts.

"Sorry hyung, I didn't mean to scare you!"

"Don't worry, can I help with something else?"

"No, just… I have to go get Yoonie, you just have to take the cake out of the oven in 40 minutes, I put a timer on my phone but if you could put one on yours…"

Taehyung looks at him take off his apron and he thinks how each of Jungkook’s gestures holds... some sort of indescribable beauty. But if taehyung were to try anyway, he would use the words “sweet” and “simple”. Kind of like   how loving Jungkook was…sweet and simple.

Love?

Taehyung's eyes widened like saucers and he choked down on his own saliva. Jungkook, tidying up the counter top looked up at him then hastened to fill a glass of water for him.

“Hyung! Are you okay?”

“Ye- cough cough- yes yes”, he said in a strangled voice. “Just swallowed wrong!”

Jungkook's face lights up with a smile.

A sweet and simple smile.

Taehyung finishes drinking his drink and walks around the counter to go and do the dishes.

Ah but leave it, hyung, I'll do it when I get home!

Yes yes, go get the kid!

Jungkook murmurs a thank you, delicately placing his left hand on the bad of the doctor's dis and the latter freezes. Jungkook is already at the door, putting on his shoes, and Taehying still hasn't moved. The gesture was sweet and simple. And his heart still beats as if he had just run a marathon, strong and loud.

Do I love him? No, if course I don't! I just appreciate him…

Yeah, that's it. That's what it is: appreciation. Taehyung still can't wrap his mind around the fact that 10 mns ago he was aroused by the younger. He never felt like this beside his ex husband. Taehyung couldn't feel sexual attraction easily. He had to know people, have some kind of bond, not necessarily a romantic one! He had sex sometimes with some of his friends or acquaintances at med school but he had to feel close to that person. And he must admit, jungkook and him grew quite close the past few weeks, especially on children's day. But that has nothing to do with love. It was only affection, attraction and some kind of sexual desire. Nothing more.

Isn't it?

“Okay would you stop smiling stupidly at that same article you've been reading for an hour now?” Hoseok asked, jetant un petit oreiller orné d’une tête de pug à la tete de taehyung. Cela eut le mérite de le tirer de ses pensées. Pensées qu’il essayait désespérément de garder aussi loin de Jungkook que possible mais failing miserably.

“What? Th- This article is just very informative, Hyung!”

“Oh, yes! It is, indeed! But it's also a 12 minutes read and not very fun material… So spill! Oh! Did you bang your babysitter?”

“What? Hyung, no!”

“Yeah, I thought so… Banging is fun and you're the President of the I-Hate-Fun-And-I’m-Proud-Of-It Club!”

Taheyung retourna l’oreiller à son propriétaire. Et s’il y mit un peu plus de force que nécessaire,  c’était un totalement accidentel.

Ils étaient dans le bureau de Hoseok, après la fin de leur chirurgie. Ce dernier avait fini sa journée et attendait qu’un autre collègue finisse pour qu’ils aillent ensemble à leur cours de danse. Taehyung était exténué mais il avait encore quelques sources à compiler pour une présentation qu’il faisait au prochain séminaire des Chirurgiens Cardio-thoraciques qui avait lieu à New-York dans 5 semaines. Son esprit était loin du séminaire, de la procédure qu’il étudiait et plus loin encore de l’article qu’il était censé digérer. Non, son esprit était occupé par les mains de Jungkook sur ses hanches, les lèvres de Jungkook sur les siennes, les joues rouges de Jungkook, allongé sur le lit-

Jungkook. Jungkook. Jungkook.

Taehyung secoua la tête dans une tentative desespérée de chasser le jeune homme de ses pensées.

“Plus, I can't have sex with him, Hyung! He's my employee!

Hoseok didn’t even bother lever l’avant-bras qui recouvrait ses yeux: “And?”

“And-“, commença Taehyung mais s’arrêta pour penser. La conversation de la veille l’avait rendu encore plus confus qu’avant, si cela était possible.

“And I don't want that kind of power play between us!”

Le silence se fit assourdissant dans la pièce si bien que Taehyung releva la tête de la revue qu’il ne faisait plus semblant de lire à présent mais dont il triturait le coin des pages. Hoseok se redressa alors d’un coup sur son canapé, écarta les jambes et se servit de ses cuisses comme support pour ses coude. Sa bouche était ouverte. Wide.

“Oh! So you want some kind of play with him! Just not that kind…” Il se gratta le bas du menton, perdu dans ses pensées. “Oh my God, he must really be pretty then! Maybe Joon didn't bullshit me this time, after all!”

“I find the fact that you speak to my brother very disturbing. And the fact that you talk about me even more!”

“Well, I must admit my weeks would be very boring without my Friday Tae and Beer Talk with Joonie... And it has nothing to do with the fact that he rails me ag-“

“We almost had sex with Jungkook, yesterday”, said tae, desperate to couper court à tout autre mot qui sortirait de la bouche de son collègue. Il s’attendait à ce que Hoseok l’ignore et continue à déblatérer des détails sur sa vie sexuelle mais, vraisemblablement, les mots de Taehyun le surprirent trop pour relever.

“Oh my, Tae Tae Bear!” — “Hyung, don't call me like that!”, tried the younger — “But what's with the /almost/?”

“Told you, he's-“

“Enough with the Kim TM bullshit, what is it?”

Taehyung didn’t know. But maybe that’s why he needed someone to confide in with. So he can understand what the fuck was going on with him! So he decided to be honest: “I- I don't know... It's been so long, Hyung! And I was so... So horny! Like, if you saw him, you’d understand! He's not only pretty. He's so kind and selfless! He’s funny and stubborn and fierce in his own way, kind of like a tide? Relentless and powerful, yet calm and deep… Oh! And, of course, h’es amazing with Yoonie... Hyung, he's-he's beautiful…”

Nouveau silence, pendant lequel Hoseok se contenta de hausser un sourcil, une invitation pour Taehyung à continuer à parler. Mais le plus jeune n’avait apparemment rien à ajouter ou Hoseok perdit patience.

“And that's your reason for not having sex with him? He's beautiful?”

“N-no I-“

Taehyung sighed. Il savait que Hoseok ne comprendrait pas. Mais, to be fair, il n’avait pas vraiment tout dit.

“I think he likes me... I mean more than platonically.”

“Again that's your reason f-“

Taehyung was getting pissed at Hoseok’s tone, now.

“He's just too good and it’s been so long and I'm ficking afraid Hyung… Seriously, it's not- I mean beside the fact that I have a lunatic breathing down my neck, I don't know him! Like, /at all/! I justt- I don't know him, Hyumg...”

The paper he was fumbling with teared and teared he silence between them. Hoseok sembla prendre cela comme un signal: il se leva, s’approcha et attira la tête de Taehyung pour la poser contre son ventre, l’enlaçant et caressant gentiment ses cheveux.

“I know, I'm sorry I had to push you but sometimes you get so lost in your insane code of conduct that you forget that it's fueled by your emotions and-“

“Don't psychoanalyze me, Hyung! Don’t you fucking dare!”

“I’m not, Tae Tae Bear… I swear I’m not! You should admit that I'm right though... It's been a year and what you've been through is horrible. That still doesn’t mean everyone is bad... You can never know someone entirely! At some point, you have to trust. And I know it's hard to do that since the last time you trusted someone it turned out to be some crazy creep but you can learn again. Or rather, you already know how to trust, you just have to allow yourself to do so.”

“That's the thing, Hyung... He has this- this aura about him! I don't know him much but I trust him. A lot. I mean I let him onto my house! I know it's also because I want whatever is the best for Yoonie but still... I trust him. And that scares the shit out of me because... It's been easy to trust him. It wasn't that easy even before ELEPHANT!”

“Then relax and enjoy the ride, Tae Tae Bear! I'm pretty sure Joonie did a background check on him-“

“Isn't that illegal?”

“That's why in saying ‘pretty sure’, cause your brother stil loves his job and would never jeopardise his career. But he told me about Jungkook, you know? Yes, he did mention that he's built like some Greek god statue, during one of our Friday Tae and Beer talks. And that he has this mole right under his lower lip and that it’s sexy as fuck. Oh and thay he has very cute big round doe eyes and- actually, I'm still mad at you for not introducing me yet!”

Taehying half chuckled and hald sniffled which sounded like a sob. Hoseok se détacha de lui pour vérifier qu’il ne pleurait pas et voyant que non, le serra encore plus fort.

“He told me about these things but also how he's so easy to be around? And how you smile and have the same bright eyes as before when you're both in the same room... Also, I know how to make someone suffer physically and psychologically. Say the word and- No actually, you don't even have to say anything. I'd tear anyone to pieces if they lay a finder on you... Still waiting for Joon to keep his promise to find and bring me that motherfucker ex of yours so i can give him a little piece of my mind!”

***Come to the roof.***

Taehyung looked at his phone, eyebrows knotted. Maybe it was spam? He was about to throw the object on the couch when it vibrated again.

***Or Jimin will not like what will happen to him.***

***And don’t even try to warn the police or your brother.***

Taehyung's blood swirled. He knew very well who the sender of these messages was. He opened his contact list and scrolled down to Namjoon's name.

*And don’t even try to warn the police or your brother.*

Taehyung changed his mind. He was scared, of course! For him, for Jimin… For Yoongi too: what would happen to the little boy if anything happened to Taehyung? But he couldn't let fear take hold of him. If there was one thing Taehyung was sure of, it was that ELEPHANT was very dangerous and wouldn't hesitate to carry out his threat. Putting on a jacket and his white sneakers frantically, he grabbed his keys on the fly and slammed the door behind him.

—————

It wasn't cold, it was already at least July, it had been hot and humid all day, making clothes and hair stick to your skin as soon as you ventured outside a little too long. Even at this fairly late hour of the evening, it was not cold, quite the contrary. That didn't stop Taehyung from shivering when his eyes met ELEPHANT’s.

He had changed a little since the last time they had seen each other: his hair was longer, pulled back into a ponytail, he was more emaciated, drier. But it was his eyes that frightened Taehyung the most: they were extinguished, as if lifeless, two dead, colorless oceans.

“Hyung-ah,” ELEPHANT said as a hello. And Taehyung remembered how much he had come to hate that nickname, over the past year.

“How have you been doing?”

Taehyung didn't answer. Fear nailed him to the spot and shut him down. He was afraid of the man who had shared 10 years of his life and who, however, was a stranger to him now. He was also afraid to speak, afraid that his voice would betray him and expose how much ELEPHANT still affected him. But, seeing his ex-husband's smirk, Taehyung wasn't sure he had managed to hide anything so far.

“Why the silent treatment? Are you mad at me, Hyung-ah?”

Okay, maybe Taehyung was more angry than afraid now because he snapped: “Of course I'm mad at you! What the fuck, ELEPHANT! I know you're the one behind Yoongi's kidnapping!”

"Did you think I'd hurt him? I know he has family in New-Zealand, my men found his aunt and I was just going to send him to her! Hyung-ah, I'm not a bad person, I'd never hurt anyone, especially not a kid! ”

“But you did, you fucking did! Maybe he didn't have a scratch but he cried for days after that! He was not okay and he's still not! And why would you do that?! Why would you try to send him to his family or whatever?”

“So you don’t need that Jungkook, anymore… So you won’t meet him again.”

His answer was so simple yet so wrong. He reminded him of that wretched night when he confronted him about drugging him and he just admitted to it, like it was just a minor detail. Back then, he said it so calmly, it made Taehyung's blood boil with rage. And that was what was happening now, too.

“And why- WHY would you meddle in my life? What gives you the right to decide who I meet or-“

"You're mine, that's why I have the right."

“I'm not yours, ELEPHANT! I'm not! You don't own me, I'm not an object! You can't own people! So don't-“

"I can and I do, Hyung-ah and you're my person. We promised to love each other until death do us apart, you remember?“

Taehyung was stunned. No, he was tired. He felt like he was talking to a wall and it reminded him of all those years they'd fight and Taehyung would just give up, tired of all the screaming and all the mess and all the hurt.

“What do you want, ELEPHANT? Why are you here?”

For the first time since he got to the roof, ELEPHANT began fidgetting.

“I-I need help, Hyung-ah…I really need help! And you're the only one who can help me! See, I-I’m dying…”

Silence settled. A silence where Taehyung's mind raced a thousand miles an hour, thinking about all that this entailed. Was ELEPHANT sick? How could Taehyung help him, then? Isaac and his family owned half the hospitals in the country, they had specialists in spades and the means to bring in more, if needed. Taehyung thought he would be relieved to hear that but he wasn't: he was worried.

“How can I help?” he asked calmly.

Was he supposed to want to help someone who had ruined his life so much, hurt him and hurt him so much? Someone who had a little boy kidnapped just so their babysitter wouldn't be in his life? Did that mean he still loved him? Did he still have feelings for ELEPHANT?

“You see, I can't live without you, I really tried… I really did, Hyung-ah! I left this shit hole of a life you put me in for 2 years, thinking I'd give you time to reflect back and miss me and reach out to me again, when you'd realize you still love me. I thought I could do it, for us… But it took you too long and I wondered why… Guess you’re replacing me with that bum, huh?”

“What are you talking about?”

The wind hits hard against Taehyung’s face. He feels two contradictory things at once: light as a feather, like all his existence and his problems weigh nothing. And he feels plagued by the weight of his dread. His heart is beating like crazy and his throat hurts but he doesn't know why. Oh! It must be because he's screaming his lungs out.

An absurd thought seized him: The stars above him are invisible. What a shame that he only can say goodbye to a starless sky.

A black thing sneaks past his eyes. He doesn't have the time to wonder what it is that he feels something grab him and lift him. He then clung to it since his life depended on it.


The next time he opens his eyes, he's behind some kind of bush, feet (shins? tibias ELEPHANT) well on solid ground. His heart hasn't stopped beating but his mind still can't understand. He looks up and finally he meets Jungkook's big eyes. Tears gather at the corners of Taehyung's eyes.

“Jung-Jungkook…?”

“Are you okay? Are you hurt?”

“Jungkook I think- I think I'm dead…”

Because how could he explain the feathers behind Jungkook? He must be dead and an angel must be here to collect his soul or something. Maybe angels have the face of the people we love before we die?

“No, you're not dead, baby… you're not dead.”

Taehyung feels Jungkook's strong arms envelop him and hug him strongly. He's not dead. He's alive, in Jungkook's arms. And Jungkook has wings, somehow.

“Oh! It must be the shock or I'm having a concussion then…”

His voice is very doctor Taehyung like, professional and almost detached.

“What? Are you hurt somewhere?”

“No… I don't feel any pain but I'm seeing things…”

“Things?”

“Yeah… I see wings…”

“Fuck!”

“Oh nevermind… they disappeared.”

“Tae, precious, look at me.”

Taehyung tears his eyes away from jungkook's shoulders and dives into his reassuring gaze.

“I need to go see if that fucker is still there, can you wait for me here until I come back?”

Taehyung nods, only half registering Jungkook's question.

“Okay, don't move, I'll be back very shortly, okay?”

Taehyung looks behind Jungkook, at where the wings were, still without answering.

He shakes him, gently.

“Taehyung! Please, I need an answer.”

“Yeah…”

The wings reappear and flap once, twice, and Jungkook disappears as if he was never there.

Taehyung struggles to breathe. Finally, he has trouble regulating his breathing, he breathes very quickly and very hard. Suddenly he feels light and it's the black hole.

Consequences 1
Whispers and something soft and warm and wet in his hand. This is what wakes Taehyung from his sleep. He only sees white at first and, given the light that reigns here, he is definitely not in his room.

Panicked, he tries to get up but his limbs are heavy and he has aches all over which make him wince in pain.

“Tae!”

That's Jimin's voice on his left so he turns his head towards it and meets his best friend's worried gaze.

“Oh my God! I'm gonna call the doctor!”

“Taetaebear!”

This time it's Jin's voice and sweet smile he sees. He doesn't have the time to ask what's happening before the hot damp thing on his hand begins wiggling. He turns toward his right and sees Yoongi, on a high chair, his head on his stomach, a hand on his hand. He rubs his eyes as if he just woke up and when he meets Taehyung's gaze, he is more alert and shouts "Ahjussi!"

Taehyung has no idea what he's doing lying on this bed, in this hospital room – given the characteristic smell that permeates the atmosphere.

“Wh-“

His voice is coarse.

“Don't talk, Jimin went to fetch the doctor! Do you want some water?”

He nods yes.

“Hoseok-ssi, can you help him straighten up?” Jin says as he walks over to the corner table and pours some water into a glass and puts a straw on it.

The assistant has barely finished straightening the bed when the doctor enters the room, followed closely by Jimin and Namjoon.

“Kim-ssi, your brother here told me you're a doctor so… you're fine, just in shock. You were very stressed and I ordered some blood tests and rest.”

“What happened?”, he asked after finally finished drinking.

“I'll let the detective here explain everything to you! Please, rest!”

“Yes, thanks doctor.”

“How are you feeling?” Namjoon asked.

“I feel a little… tired. Yeah… and I have body aches and- what happened?”

The last he remembered was-

“ELEPHANT! He was there yesterday!” he jumped.

Namjoon put a hand on his shoulder to put him back in his place.

“Yes, thanks to your text, I could be there moments after-“

“Did you catch him? Where's Jungkook?”

Something about Jungkook seeps through his thoughts. An angel. Jungkook with wings.

“He had already left when I arrived and Jungkook is-“

They all looked to a corner of the room where Jungkook was hunched on a chair, slumped but his intense gaze riveted on Taehyung as if he was keeping him nailed on his bed with his simple gaze.

“He didn't say a word and hasn't moved from here since yesterday”, Jimin whispered.

“Jungkook, are you-“

Jungkook stood up abruptly, startling everyone in the room. He looked at Tae for a few seconds then headed out.

***

It was his fault. His fucking fault. If he had spent less time daydreaming about Taehyung, he would probably have found the spirit before he clung to Taehyung’s ex and tried to harm more than Yoongi. He probably wasn't fit for the mission… he had to call Hanee and tell her to-

“Are you okay?”

Jungkook quickly turned towards the source of the voice, in attack position.

“Wow wow, easy there tiger! It's me!”

“Ah, Jimin-ssi. Sorry I'm-“

“It's okay”, Jimin said when Jungkook didn't finish his sentence. “I get it, the whole ELEPHANT shebang is a mess and makes everyone of us defensive. Did you eat?”

Jungkook arched an eyebrow.

“Of course you didn't, you were too busy playing watchdog! Here, let me!”

He walked to the automatic machine and bought a pack of kimbaps which he handed to Jungkook. The latter took them, without really thinking, as if he were on autopilot. He even didn't forget to say thank you.

“It's nothing… thanks for bringing Taehyung. I don't know what happened on that roof or how he ended up okay but thank you…”

This seemed to finally wake Jungkook from his torpor.

“Don’t… this is my fault.”

“What? How is it your fault, Jungkook-ssi? ELEPHANT is sick… Namjoon has been looking for him for a year now and couldn't. And believe me, he's a great detective! Who knew what would have happened if you weren't there, I mean-“

“Jimin-ssi.”

“Oh? Yes?”

“I need to be alone, right now, please…”

“Oh... Okay, I'll-yeah. Tell me if you need anything.”

***

Jungkook has disappeared. It's been 3 days since Taehyung returned home surrounded by Jin, Jimin and of course Yoongi. The two adults take turns to take care of the child and Taehyung feels terribly guilty for imposing this on them. In truth, he is fine. Physically at least. He still has a few panic attacks and the mere view of the balcony makes him nauseous. But Yoongi also seems affected by this story of which the adults have not told him everything and Taehyung does his best not to collapse, for the child. Because despite the panic attacks, the fear of the balcony that torments him, what hurts him the most and prevents him from sleeping is the absence of Jungkook.

Taehyung passed the first day of frantically calling him, scared to death that something had happened to him… that ELEPHANT had done something to him or harmed him in any way. But at the end of the day, he received a very dry text that made him more angry than anything: “I'm fine, Taehyung. I just have things to do.”

Yes, this text was infuriating.

Taehyung didn't understand and the more time passed, the more questions he had. Of course, about the wings he was sure he had seen – or was it really because he was in a delirious state? but mostly about what happened after Jungkook saved him. Because, even today, no one had been able to understand what had happened and only Jungkook had all the bits that were missing.

That night, Taehyung was alone.------- deafening silence, dizziyin —- Yoongi was particularly sullen and kept clamoring for everyone's attention so Namjoon took over with Huiyeon and had took the child out to dinner, giving the 3 adults a break. Taehyung was happy to have the apartment for himself, for once even if the absence of Jin, Jimin and Yoongi was felt. He had put on some music, had used some good wine to drown out the first signs of a panic attack he was feeling. It was then that he heard someone knock on the door. strong.

Taehyung put the glass on the table, got up and walked to the door. He was afraid, of course, that it was ELEPHANT again, even though Namjoon had assured him that he had posted agents downstairs 24/7. Officers were supposed to intervene if ELEPHANT himself or any suspicious person entered the building. But it was Jungkook.

Taehyung opened both padlocks as fast as he could and Jungkook collapsed in his arms.

***

jk pov against the spirit

***

Jungkook was lying on the sofa, presumably passed out. Taehyung had laid him down and felt a damp area on his back and on his abdomen.

He had placed a cushion under his head

He went to the bathroom to look for his first aid kit and it was under the harsh light of the room that he saw the red on his hands. He put the box on the toilet lid and clutched the sink, careful not to look at himself. but he was unable to look at anything other than his hands, the blood anyway. He was breathing heavily, feeling a panic attack coming on. But he had things to do like preventing Jungkook from dying on his couch. He then turned on the tap and washed his hands, the pink water finding its way to the siphon.


If huiyeon sees jk in this state, she will surely remove Yoongi's custody. So he led him to his own room. He was even tempted to call them and ask them to babysit Yoongi for the night. But Yoongi had been very stressed by JK's absence and he was sure that spending the night with his brother was not going to help with his separation anxiety.

As he moved him, Jungkook writhes in pain and Taehyung realizes he has probably a broken or cracked rib.

He returned to the bedroom, lifted jk's t-shirt and what he saw horrified him as well as impressed him. There was a wound the size of his forearm, running from the bottom of his pec to his side. It was of course not clean but at the ends, Taehyung saw that it was already closing. It was like seeing a time-lapse video.

Taehyung came out of his torpor and began to cut the tshirt then clean the wound. Jungkook's waist was so small compared to his broad shoulders…! Taehyung did everything he could not to let his eyes roam/stray anywhere and kept them firmly on the wound.


He knew that Jungkook had another back injury and he needed to clean that up too. He patted Jungkook’s cheek, hard but as tenderly as possible.

“Jungkook, Jungkook, wake up, I need to tend your back wound and dress this one.”

Jungkook came to, blinking his eyes. They fell on Taehyung, he looked distraught, he tried to get up but his rib held him in place.

“What are you doing here? Taehyung, you need to-“

“Jungkook, jungkook, it's okay, you're safe, we're safe, we're home.”

He said that with his right hand on jungkook's cheek. With his thumb he gently caressed the other. Jungkook seemed lost for a moment then looked around. Then he seemed to calm down but still had trouble breathing normally.

“I need you to take off the remains of your shirt and um… yeah, I need to put bandages around your waist.”

“It's okay, I don't need- I heal pretty fast.”

“Yeah.. I saw that. It's a good thing but it could also be dangerous as we need to be quick about it. I think you have a broken rib too, I'll prescribe some XXX for you and you need to be very careful and rest.”

“I can not. I really can't.”

“What happened? What can be so important that you put your life in danger like that?”

“Yoongi’s life and yours…”

Taehyung looked at him blankly, not really understanding.

“You saw my wings, you saw how I heal quickly…”

“Yeah…? And I have so many questions but I need to dress your wounds so please, get up first, we'll talk about that when you're rested. Now is not the time.”

Jungkook got up as best he could, stopping himself from screaming in pain. Taehyung wrapped the bandage around his tiny waist, trying not to think about the closeness of their bodies, the warmth of Jungkook. When he was done, he kept Jungkook sitting on the edge of the bed and knelt on the bed behind him to clean the wound. There was dried blood that had caked on and Taehyung cleaned it all up. Beneath the blood, he only saw a scar that was a bit sharp, as if 3 or 4 days old. Closed.

“This is insane…”

“What is?” Jungkook asked.

“It's- it's like- it's almost healed…”

“Ah… yeah.”

“What are you? An angel?”

Jungkook chuckled but stopped immediately with a wince.

“No, I'm a Reaper.”

Taehying was stunned. He moved forward slightly so that their faces were face to face.

“A Reaper? Like an actual Reaper that collects souls and all?”

“Yeah… angels and demons are way more invincible than us, as reapers are human before they die.”

“I'm sorry… what?? You died?”

It was too much information. Jungkook lifted his head slightly to meet Taehyung’s gaze and only then did he realize how close they were. Taehyung's chest was against Jungkook’s shoulder and their noses were almost touching. Jungkook looked down slightly at Taehyung’s lips and the latter, as in some kind of trance or a knee jerk reaction, passed his tongue over his lower lip.

Jungkook must have taken that for an invitation as he looked up at Taehyung with a question in his eyes. Taehyung wasn't sure, his brain was working at 1000 an hour. But his body was acting for him and he nodded surreptitiously. Jungkook leaned and-

And their lips touched.

It was a peck, a simple peck, nothing heated but the butterflies that lived in Tae Hyung's stomach soared and rumbled. The kiss was too brief and he craved more. But before he leaned a bit more, eager to repeat the experience, the bell from the bottom of the building rang, startling both of them and breaking the spell. Jungkook even hissed.

Taehyung straightened up quickly and without giving jungkook a look, headed for the door.

"Don't move, it's Joonie hyung, Huiyeon-ssi and Yoongi, I don't want them to ask questions about why you're soaking my bedsheets in blood or his assistant ELEPHANT of a girlfriend to take away Yoonie from me cause you're soaking my bedsheets in blood, okay?"

He does not wait for an answer before leaving. He opened the door to Namjoon and looked in panic towards the couch where a stain of blood impregnated the backrest. There was some blood drops on the floor too. He had never been so happy with the very Boho decor of his apartment. He took a few cushions and arranged them to hide the stain and with some tissues cleaned the floor. By the time he finished, he could already hear the door code. Namjoon carried Yoongi like a sack of potatoes, the child's head on his shoulder.

"Hi!", he whispered. "He fell asleep in the car, Huiyeon stayed downstairs.."

"Ah yes!"

Taehyung rushed to grab Yoongi but Namjoon turned slightly to the other side.

"I can take him to his room, just take his bag, he won lots of goodies at the planetarium restaurant and it's pretty heavy!"

Taehyung was freaking out because he wasn't sure he had closed his bedroom door - damn sexy Jungkook and his amazing lips! - when they heard a door close.

Namjoon raised an eyebrow.

"At the planetarium? He must have been very happy!" Taehyung said, taking the bag.

"Is there someone, here?"

"No! I was just cleaning! And I must have left the window open! Don't worry!"

Namjoon didn't seem to believe him. They stared at each other for a few seconds before the giant gently pulled Yoongi up against him and started heading down the hall.

"There was a Saturn quiz and the winner got a discount on dinner or a set of goodies from the shop. He got a perfect score… so we got both…"

Taehyung smiled toothily, his heart swelling with pride for the little one whose crown and a small clenched fist protruded from his brother's shoulder. 

“Yeah he’s having a Saturn phase, I guess!”

Taehyung followed Namjoon into the bedroom and rushed to turn on the bedside lamp and remove the sheets. Then Namjoon put Yoongi down as delicately as possible. Taehyung automatically set to work removing Yoongi's shoes and jeans then tucked him. The two brothers stood still for a few seconds watching him turn around and put his hands between his thighs.

“He has the cutest sleeping habits!”

“He does… he's a good kid! I'm gonna miss him...”

Taehyung ignored the lump forming in his throat just thinking that one day this bed, this apartment… his life would be without Yoongi.

“Yeah… me too…”

Namjoon gave his brother a sad smile.

“Okay… Huiyeon is waiting so I gotta go!”

They went out from the bedroom to return to the living room but Namjoon stopped in front of Taehyung’s room.

“Any news from Jungkook?”

“Uh… still nothing…”

“I don't understand… he looked like he was serious about this job! And the way he acted in the hospital… Yoongi kept asking about Jungkook on the way to the planetarium.”

“Yeah…he really disappeared without a trace…”

“It's kinda selfish… but I guess he must have some good reason!”

Taehyung didn't know what to answer. The last three days had been hell. But knowing that Jungkook had returned… was on the other side of that door… it felt like the pain of those three days didn't matter anymore.

Namjoon smiled again and resumed walking towards the front door.

“Jin and Jimin aren't coming back tonight?” he asked putting on his shoes.

“No, Jin said he's coming back tomorrow but I think Yoongi and I need to spend some time together to digest…. Uh…Jungkook's absence.”

Namjoon sat up.

“And you feel better?”

“Yep, hyung, don't worry! I'm really good!”

“Okay! I'm a call away so don't hesitate, okay?”

“Yeah, I won't!”

As soon as Namjoon closed the door behind him, Taehyung hurried to the kitchen where he filled three glasses of water. He put one on Yoongi's bedside table, and took the rest of the tray to his room.

Jungkook was on the bed, lying down and asleep. Taehyung checked his temperature and pulse but they were regular. He wondered if he should sleep in the office, the room Jungkook used to sleep. But he needed to stay by his side. First to make sure he was fine and to help him if he needed to. And also because he is happy that Jungkook has returned to him… But also out of fear that Jungkook will relart without a word. He vaguely felt that Jungkook had come tonight without really thinking. And Taehyung didn't want to take any chances. So he walked around the bed and lay down next to Jungkook.

The last thing he saw were the latter's lips.

***

It is still relatively dark when Taehying wakes up. He's hot and wants to kick the blankets but he realizes that it's the arm around his waist and the leg between his thighs that's making him hot. Jungkook snores lightly, his breath tickling the back of Taehyung's neck. Somehow, during the night, they got so tangled up. And Taehyung wasn't complaining about it until he felt something against his butt.

Taehyung is a doctor. Of course, he knows that Morning Wood is a normal bodily reaction, nothing to do with lust or any sexual urge or attraction. Taehyung knows it. But maybe it's the kiss from the night before or the fact that it's been over a year and a half since he's been with someone, but that simple fact clouds his brain and gives him thoughts that make it even warmer if possible.

He feels his own hardness taking hold and feels terribly guilty thinking about Jungkook's hands on his chest, his abdomen. To think what it would be like if the breath on his face turned into kisses. If Jungkook turned it over there and-

Jungkook shifts in his sleep and in the smoothest motion, buries himself in Taehyung, clinging even closer to him.

Taehyung's heart is racing and he feels his cheeks turning red. He is hot but doesn't dare move. Jungkook's arm on his waist...

"AHJUSSHIIIIII!"

Taehyung gasps, followed by a moan of pain from Jungkook.

Kookie H-hyung?

Taehyung sees Yoongi's eyes widen then his mouth forms a pout and he starts sniffling.

Jungkook sits on the bed and smiles kindly at Yoongi then he opens his arms and the child throws himself into them, pulling out a real cry of pain this time.

"Be careful, little one! Hyung is um… fell and he's injured."

"You fell?" Yoongi says, looking at him intently.

"Yeah! But I'm okay, tomorrow I'll be as good as new!"

Yoongi hugs Jungkook again bit very carefully this time and Ju gkook pats his head and kisses the crown of his hair.

"I missed you, kiddo!"

"Pancakes, anyone?"

Yoongi pokes his head out of Jungkook's chest and Taehying caresses his cheeks and wipes away his tears as he nods.

"Can I make them? Jin samcheon showed me how to use the pancake mix!"

"Really? That's amazing! You know where the mix is? The measuring cup? The bowl?"

Yoongi nodded yes with 3 questions.

"Go then! Don't touch the stove or any knife! I'll be here in a minute, I need to talk to Jungkook, okay?"

"Yeeeees!"

He pads to the door then he turns on the threshold.

"Can we use milk instead of water like Jin samcheon does?"

"Of course! You can take it out of the fridge but don't do anything with it, until I'm there."

He turns then turns again.

"Can we add blueberries in the pancakes too like Jin samche we do?"

"I don't think we have any blueberries left but I have some fruit we can cut to eat with the pancakes if you want!"

"Okay."

Then he runs to the kitchen.

"So… you wanna talk…"

"Yeah…about why you disappeared like that on us. I need to know why and if it's gonna happen again."

Jungkook doesn't answer. He kept his eyes on his fumbling hands until he snickers.

"And here I thought you wanted to talk about the kiss…"

Taehyung feels himself turning red again.

"I- um…"

"I'm just kidding… just don't ask me to forget it. It was our first kiss and I cherish that memory even if it was done in a non ideal circumstances."

"What do you mean?"

"I'm a Reaper, as I told you yesterday. A Reaper on a mission. Yoongi's grandfather became some sort of powerful ghost spirit and he targeted him at first."

"You mean…?"

The ghost and the weird events that happened around Yoongi at first.

"Yeah… I put some talismans on your apartment and his school so he's safe there but I need to be around him and protect him when he's outside. For that, I had to become close to you. That's why I applied to become a nanny , despite my lack of experience."

"You…did you do some magic to cancel qll the other nannies?"

Jungkook lowered his head, clearly guilty.

"I swear, I weighed all my options before doing that. And we run all the statistics possible and it's not a major change so it'd be okay…"

"I don't understand half of what you're saying but okay…"

Jungkook sighed.

"It doesn't matter… I'm only saying i did whatever I could to not harm you or him in the way of protecting him."

"Okay, thanks for that, I guess!"

Jungkook smiled Weakly.

"This vengeful spirit is one of a kind. Like… he targeted Yoongi at first but after that night at your apartment where I fought him, he changed strategies…"

"What night at my apartment? What fight?"

"You probably remember the night where the window and the cupboard door were ELEPHANT…"

"You were there?"

"Yes, invisible but yes."

"Can you make yourself invisible?"

Yeah… actually, it takes me more energy staying visible as it's not my natural state.

This is - This is insane.

It's true though!

I believe you

There was no doubt in Taehyung.

I believe you, which is even more insane cause I'm probably the worst cartesian ever.

They sobseb4nt blah blah blah

So, you said I changed strategies?

Yeah… somehow he became entangled with EMPHANT ?(l'ex) and at first, i didn't notice cause it was like he disappeared from the surface en la terre! But the bight your ex came, the night you fell… I returned to the roof and I saw it, whispering into ELEPHANT'S ear.

But- what does Yoongi's grandpa has to do with ELEPHANT?

It'd take too long to explain, you can ask me details about this later, I'm sure Yoongi will come crashing in here if we don't go to him right now… but to make it simple, it's a kind of spirit that feed on nightmares and fears. And one of Yoongi's fears is probably to lose you so that's why I think the spirit is trying to harm yoongi through you. So he found someone who has some ill intent towards you and ignited it again.

I- wah.. this is too much, i feel like my head hurts. But your spirit is wrong, Yoongi and I are not that close.

What are you talking about?

I mean… we get along but like… he's much more close to you! He calls you hyung and you make him laugh! He Jin too anf calls him samcheon…. And I'm pretty sure he has a crush on Jimin! And Namjoon too, like, they get along when they talk about space stuff! Even Assistant Jung, he calls him "seokie-hyung! But he still calls me ahjussi and I'm not really fun to be around, you know.."

Bullshit! Taehyung… he's afraid of losing you. Not to pull any psychology shit or anything but you're all he talks about when you're not around. Taehyung ahussi did this, tahehying ahjussi did that… that kid has some special taehyung battery or something I swear! That thing… it feeds on nightmares, you see? Like… it's a sneaky little thing, far smarter than I thought. He learned that as long as I'm with him, he can't physically harm him. So it resorted to the next best thing: making his nightmares become true. And apparently one of his fears is losing you.

So I'm I danger and because of me, yoongi is in damage too…

Your brain works in mysterious ways! I don't know how you got that from what I said!

AHJUSHIIIIII! CAN I OPEN THE MILK?

Taehyung laughed impatiently at Dr. Yoongi.

Better go than take the risk if him spilling milk!

Before getting up, jmtaehyung grabbed jungkook's hand.

He lives you too, you know? He cried almost nonstop for the last 3 days. I get that you need to uhm…fight that monster or hunt it but he-we need you. You're not alone in this.

Jungkook brought Taehyung's hand to his mouth and placed a kiss there.

Taehyung blushed again but with another call from yoongi, he got up and walked to the kitchen.






The buzz is still there, comme un incessant ronronnement contre his wrist. Jungkook regarde son poignet et les threads qui brillent légèrement. Il est tenté d'y répondre bien sûr mais il n'est pas prêt à gérer ce que cela veut dire. Ses actions ces derniers jours - sauver Taehyung, reveler sa nature, confronter SU - n'étaient pas vraiment permises. C'était même contraire aux règles. D'habitude, Jungkook avait une pretty much control over his emotions. But the stress of this case, being without Hanee's guidance and his feelings for Taehyung and his attachment to Yoongi… He felt like it was too much. Maybe he must have stepped down and let other Reapers take care of this case. But no-one would be as involved as he is, no-one had established the right relationship and no-one had the same motivation to keep them alive as he had.

Jungkook tire la manche de son sweatshirt par-dessus les threads et se lève pour rejoindre les deux autres en cuisine.

Les pa cakes sont très bons, Taehyung a decoupé des rondelles de bananes et a sorti le sirop d'érable. Ils mangerent avec appetit, jungkook essayant de rattraper ce qu'il a raté de la vie Dr Tae et Yoongi. D'un coup, Yoongi ouvre les yeux grands comme des soucoupes, fixant quelque chose derrière Jungkook et Taehyung. Taehyung est le premier à remarquer et à se retourner.

"Is there something there?"

Jungkook se retourne à son tour et ouvre la bouche devant une Hanee. Sa colère est aussi grande qu'elle est petite et Jungkook se demande comment il a fait pour ne pas avoir blablabla. Avec un pincement au cœur, il se rappelle la dernière fois qu'ils se sont parlés. 

"Noona!"

"Noona?"

Jungkook ne le voit pas, il a les heux fixes sur hanee mais Taehyung fronce les sourcils sans comprendre.

"Jungkook… is there an invisible woman in our kitchen?"

Vu qu'il ne lui répond pas, Taehying se tourne verd Yoongi qui acquiesce lentement.

"And you can see her?"

"Ahsjussi… she appeared like from thin air!"

Taehyung se leve rt met led majns sur les hanches.

"Okay, lady! It's rude! At least show yourself!"

Hanee sighs then grumble a "See I knew this would happen!" before making herself visible. Of course, hungkook don't notice the difference until Taehyung litteraly shouts a "what the hell!"

"I'm sorry for intruding like this, Kim Taehyung-ssi. My name is Lee Hanee and I'm Jungkook's boss. It's been more than 3 days ee couldn't reach him and I was- I mean we were quite worried. I had to come see if something happened and I kinda forgot Yoongi here can see Reapers."

"What's a reaper?"

"This is getting out of hand… I thought you told the kid and your lover here about everything!"

This seemed to faire bouger qq chose en jungkook.
"Noona! Can we- euh… yeah! Come here!"

Jungkook took her hand and took her to his room and closed the door. Sur le chemin il entendit des chuchotements. 

"L-lover?"

"Ahjussi! Are you and hyung in love?"

Il souffla acant de ferner la porte.

What are you doing here?

Like I said! It's been three days and we haven't received a single report from you! Worse! We had news about infractions in your vicinity! Tu as empêché la mort de qqun! Et tu as révélé ta nature! 2 des 3 interdits capitaux!

That's why I didn't answer… the spirit involved Taehyung's ex and he was gonna kill him!

You want to tell me that it wasn't a natural death?

No! I was there! I saw the vengeful spirit!

Before or after you saved him?

Jungkook baissa les yeux. 

Does that really matter?

Elle le regarda, tristement.

Of course it does! You've been summoned! The bureau is preparing for a disciplinary hearing and all!

Cetait plus grave que ce qu'il pensqit. Une ecoute disciplinary etait rare mais il etait encore plus rare que cela se finisse bjen.

Is this why you're here? To take me away?

What?

Jungkook ne regardait toujours pas Hanee, jouant avec la mache de son hoodie.

Kookie, look at me.

Il leva enfkn les ysux vers elle.

I'm not here to take you but to warn you. The hearing will procede wethere you're there to defend yourself or not. XXX and me did whatever we could to slow things and contact you but you've been ignore us- ignoring ME for 3 days!

We haven't been on the best terms lately… I knew I was in trouble and I knew I deceived you… again. 

You- kookie! I'm beyond proud of you! I am, insista-t-elle devant le regard inceedule de jungkook. The Ness you were when we first met… and the beautiful mindful and selfless soul you became through all the years we knew each other. I admit I may have over reacted last time.

You didn't. I look up to you a lot and my biggest fear was to deceive you. That's why I didn't- I didn't share this things with you. But you were right! You always were patient with me and gave me your trust so yeah…

Was?

Huh?

Your biggest fear was to deceive me… that's what you said. So it's not that anymore?

Jungkook sourit tristement, ses oreilles prenant jne teinte ecarlate. Il les saisit sans s'en rendre compte.

Yeah.

Elle n'insista pas.

But the fact that the killer was acting under the influence of the vengeful spirit is actually a good thing! You have to attend the hearing so they can access your memories! Maybe they'll let you off the hook…

When will it be?

You know how hectic it is to schedule a Reapers hearing. I heard Byul is going to defend you, which definitely ruffled some feathers but you know her, when she sets her mind on something, it's very hard to change her mind. I'll work with her to postpone everything as much as we can but since it could last days, you need to wrap up things here as fast as you can. 

Noona… thank you.

Kook, no need to thank me. 

She hugged him whispering a little I love you brat and disappeared.


Jungkook sort de lq chambre et trouve Yoongi en train de faire se devoirs tandis que Taehyung range le lave-vaisselle. Both arretent leurs activités et le regardent quand ils entendent la porte de sa chambre ae refermer.

Kookie hyung! Is your noona an angel?

Yoongi, dear… what did I tell you about this question?

Not to ask ahjussi anymore so I'm asking hyung.

That's not-

Tae se passe la main sur le visage en souriant.

So?

His eyes asks the question: "are you in trouble?"

Jungkook doesn't want to answer the question because he doesn't want to lie but he doesn't want to worry Taehyung either.

Yoongi regarde entre les deux puis dans un soupir se lève.

I'll let you have adult talk, I'll be in my room!

And hebheads to the room.

Since when he became this mature?

He always have been.. sometimes I forget he's only seven! I feel bad, though…

Yeah me too.. but even if he's super smart I still want to protect him and shelter him from… death.

Are you in danger ?

Not immediately, no. Thr thing is… I mean you probably already know but you weren't supposed to make it, last time. And there's only three rules we absolutely can't ELPHANT. The second one is to not interfere in someone's death. If it's his time then it's his time. The third is to never reveal our existence to mortals. As you can see… I enrrained two by saving you.

I get it… so what now?

I- there's a trial. I've been summoned. I don't know where it is but I have to attend when it'll happen so I can prove at least that your death wasn't natural.

I'm sorry?

It was commendited by a spirit. Which goes against the first and most important law: ensure that death does not interfere in the mortal lives so their death is the most fair and just possible.

What?

Like.. Our boss, the fate of death. She's obsessed with this concept. Like I don't understand why but yeah…

Is this fate gonna be in your trial?

I doubt it… no-one saw her for at least 5 centuries!

Okay… what are the possible issues?

If it goes well, nothing… but worst case scenario, I die.

Tae oubre la bouche aans comprendre. Puis se rappelle qq cjowe que yoongi lui a deja dit.

But you're… already dead, right? So you can't die again?

Hah. Exact. But I still can disappear completely. I'll be forgotten by everyone who knew me in my life and in my death. And I heard its quite painful.

What can I do?

Nothing really… beside taking care of yoongi like you've been doing. We needed him to stay in Korea so it's easier to track the spirit so you won't hear from his family yet. Not before this mess is settled. So until then…

You mean he's still there because of you?

Jungkook ne comprend pas.

That's… that came out wrong. I love the little one and really, I wish he could stay as long as possible. But the more he stays the more moving on into his family will be difficulty for him.

Taehyung worried. Jungkook reassures him. They kiss. They speak about what they are (no label cause


# I'm sorry, I can't

I'm sorry, I can't

What do you mean?

Believe me you don't want this Taehyung

So you know better than me what I want? Bullshit cause I want you

I can't, Tae. Everything i touch I fuck up and i- i don't want to hurt you. I can't

Why would you fuck me up?

Because that's what I do, I'm a bad person, it's like a curse so stay away from me

You say that but I Don't see you moving, you want this

I don't- I can't, I'm a bad person, I'll hurt you

Why do you think you're a bad person? That's ridiculous and fat from the truth No it's not, you know nothing about me, Taehyung so don't talk-

I know you're kind and generous and respectful toward your elders. I know you love Yoongi and take care of him in ways I can't. I know you've trued to help namjoon with haesu’s case when it doesn't benefit you at all. I know you're still trying hard to save yoongi from that spirit and don't tell me it's your job, it goes beyond than that.

You don't understand

Then explain to me why you're a bad person I can't do that

Why

I just can't, tae, leave it

Why can't you, Why?

Because I love you, ok?

I've been in love with you for a while now and I can't stand to see the way you look at me change if I tell you everything. It's selfish but I wouldn't br able to handle it.

The way I look at you?

Untitled 1

I'm maybe getting ahead of myself but I love the way you look at me, like I'm someone that exists. Like I'm someone who matters. Who you gave a place into your life and still doesn't regret it. Like maybe...

There's no maybe, kook. I love you. Others would say we didn't know each other for long or that I don't know enough about you but I know the most important parts and I'm willing to open my heart to you and learn all the rest. So you can tryst me with your burden, kook. You know it'd take a lot for me to change the way I think and feel about you.

Kook says challenge accepted cause he just wants to prove to tae he's unlovable

My greed wiped out my entire clan and family. I was born the son of a general whose courage was known in all the country and beyond the borders. He never put any pressure on me to become anything, to be honest, but I was eager to prove myself, to be worthy of being called his son, of holding the Jeon family name. I was 16 when he died in the battlefield, trying to protect me. I was so angry.. at him for dying. For still keeping an eye on me. I don't know. But I was also so angry at the invaders. So that day, I led our clan to an unprecedented victory. We kinda wiped out the enemy. In the next months, we did more than protect, we led strikes against the enemy, not to claim land but to weed out the problems before they got yo us. At first, it was just anger and fear of losing my family that fueled me. But soon, my name was pronounced with respect and I liked it. I was proud and greedy for more. More recognition, more respect.

That irked the crown. My name was synonymous of success and love for the kingdom of Silla, while the king was deemed lazy and a coward for staying in the Palace. I didn't know then but everytime I travelled to the capital, there was celebration for days. The common people liked me and I'd use my money and influence to help. So the king thought I was coming after his throne. Even now, I don't know how stupid I was not to understand that, not to see the signs. But greed, pride and confidence is a dangerous and blinding combination.

So when the king offered to give me his youngest sister as a gift for all the things I had done for the country, I really didn't think anything of it. I was honoured, of course but also a little embarrassed because I didn't know the first thing about women. But she was beautiful and smart and, above all, she proved herself to be a true ally. She was a true strategy mastermind and I learned a lot from her.

Untitled 2

Her name was Seolhwa.

But then, our physician dropped dead, then my sister and then a lot of people from the clan. We sent for a physician from the capital but all he said was that it was some strange incurable disease, an answer from the heavens to the lives we took. Truly, that our physician died first should have tipped me off but I was in love and didn't suspect a thing. Until one of my maids told me she saw her manipulating dried persimmons. I hated that so I never ate it but it was a known delicacy at the time and when the princess offered, you accepted. I didn't want to believe it at first but when that maid died too, I confronted Seolhwa. And she didn't even try to deny it.

The worst thing is... I let her go. Because I loved her and couldn't bear to harm her even though she killed my own sister and orphaned my niece and nephew. I gave her a head start but promised I'd kill her if I ever saw her again.

No-one knew but my brother and he hated me for forgiving Seolhwa, so much that he took my niece and nephew and left the clan.

A few months later, I was half the man I was, riddled with guilt and anger. So I gathered my men and told them everything. I wanted revenge so I made sure to plant the seed of hatred in them. That's why we travelled to the capital, for a few years, gathering people under our rebels banner. Albeit small, I ended with an army following me. They wanted change. I just wanted the king amd his family to be dead.

I was declared a traitor and the palace sent their own soldiers. Seolhwa was in the front line. And I kept my promise, I killed her. I still dream about our fight, her fierceness, the smirk she had while defending herself, never attacking me. Her last words. She said that she loved me and that she was never as happy as when she was with my clan. But she had a daughter in the Palace, kept hostage. That she had to do what she did to protect her. But now that her daughter no longer lived, she came to the battlefield to give me the only thing she still could: revenge.

I looked around me then and I saw what my quest got the people I loved: death. My army was brave and the members from my clan knew how to fight. But the ones we took alo g the way didn't. And we were clearly outnumbered. I lost everything that day and I knew it wasn't anyone's fault but mine.

I killed myself that day, crying and bleeding above Seolhwa’s body.

~~ tea break 🍵

I wish I could say fucking up a few hundred lives was enough but even dead, I found a way to let my greed ruin someone's life. Their name is Byeol and they're a demon.

A demon?

Untitled 3

Yes but for lack of better wording because demons are just beings working for Hell. They're not bad or evil, they're just like us. Some are good, some are bad. The thing is demons and Reapers don't really mix up. We, Reapers, live in Maeul, the city in the In Between where demons live in Hell. But Byeol and I we clicked, immediately. They're fierce and beautiful. Their passion for their job, which is defending souls in front of the Gods, really drew me in. So we kinda dated. I never went beyond the gates but they could roam the in between. What we had was casual. What you must know about demons is that they're mortals and that they're both male and female. Byeol got pregnant which was unexpected because we're kinda different species, you know. We thought it was impossible. Or, rather, they thought that, I think I never really thought about it. Still, I was happy because I always wanted to have a family and the worst day of my life is still when my brother took my niece and nephew from me. I loved those kids like they were mine, even before my brother-in-law died. Again, I wanted more than I deserved. I'm dead. How can I bring up life in this world or in the in between when I'm not even alive. I insisted we try to keep it even if the doula said it could be dangerous for Byeol. Byeol agreed too but I can't help but think they probably couldn't say otherwise with how happy and excited I was.

But Byeol lost the baby. Worse, they lost the ability to carry. They still can have a baby with another demon or female partner. But one of Byeol’s dreams was to be the one to carry a baby. I felt so guilty, I still do. I stayed with them and helped through everything. But I couldn't look them in the eye. We ended up the relationship a few months after that. I still see them, from time to time, at the gates. And it breaks my heart everytime because my greed took away their dream from a wonderful being.

        - Jungkook thinks that, a few months ago, he would have been almost relieved to finally be free and dead even if the perspective of never be reborn again and disappearing and no one remembering him was scary
        - But now that he has 2 people that loves him and are sad he’s gonna die, he wants to live so badly. He wants to be able to tell them that life has become interesting and precious not just because final death is scary but because it’s worth living with them being with him
        - Jungkook wants to live badly, even if he never can interact with Yoongi or Taehyung again, he just wants to be able to know they’re safe and doing good, he would be okay to just observe them from afar
